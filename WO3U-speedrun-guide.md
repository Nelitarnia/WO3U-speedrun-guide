# Introduction

Hello and welcome to my Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate speedrunning guide. So... why this game in particular?

This may very well be my favorite out of all the Musou-games. It has a great roster, fun glitches and a lot of content. It's absurd and intense. I find it so good that I even forgive some of its grindiness. Sadly, these games are not very popular as speed games, but I hope that will change one day.

## About Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate as a speed game

- The game is overall rather stable, and I've only seen it crash a few times in the years I've played it.

- The game doesn't have a lot of downtime. All cutscenes can be skipped and loading times aren't too long.

- It has a bunch of stylish looking time saving glitch tactics.

- Full-game runs which aim for the first ending are under 90 minutes long, which isn't too bad.

- Running other, shorter categories is also an option. For instance, individual levels are a lot of fun.

- For individual level runs or other type of NG+ runs, you have to grind to get good characters first.

- Some of the fastest tactics are RNG-heavy, although less so on the PC-version.

- Several levels contain escort missions, which are fairly slow.

# Glitch tech

First, a note about terminology. On PS3 and PS4, the internal frame rate of the game fluctuates at random. This is important to note because certain glitch effects can only happen - or work better - when frame rate is lower. In the past, I've called this effect "lag" or "background lag", and these terms may still crop up here and there in this guide.

The PC version allows the user to set their own frame rate. Setting vsync to 30 forces the game to always be in slower frame rate. In other words, PC is the more reliable platform for running any kind of glitched categories in WO3U. I will make a specific note about which glitches are influenced by vsync in the sections below.

I've divided the various glitch techniques into the following categories:

- [Jump tech](#Jump-tech). Different methods of gaining unintended height.
- [Speed movement](#Speed-movement). Different methods of fast movement.
- [Other tech](#Other-tech). Other uncategorizable tricks.

## Jump tech

- [Basic infinite jump](#Basic-infinite-jump)
- [Save and quit infinite jump](#Save-and-quit-infinite-jump)
- [Horse high jump](#Horse-high-jump)
- [Wallzipping](#Wallzipping)
- [Xu Shu high jump](#Xu-Shu-high-jump)

### General advice

Most walls in this game are essentially infinitely tall, and there's no hope of jumping past them. However, different kind of doors, gateways and other temporary obstacles have a finite height. So when you're doing these jump tactics, you should always aim for the doorways. Sometimes it can be hard to discern which part of the level design is an infinitely tall outer boundary and which is a gateway. In these cases, looking closer at the map should be helpful, as various kinds of openable doors are marked with a different color.

### Basic infinite jump

The basic infinite jump is done by chaining together air specials to gain essentially infinite height and horizontal movement in air. Normally you can only use an air special once while airborne, but you can bypass that limitation by switching characters in air. With some practice, you can learn to chain together air specials and character switching to do it pretty seamlessly.

Not every team member is equally good at infinite jumping. Some characters have an air special which ends in a downsmash, which makes them unusable for infinite jumps. Many have an air special which lets them at least hover, but they'll need to be paired with a better infinite jumper for the jump to actually go anywhere. Speed-type characters are especially valuable since they can use double jump in between air specials to make it easier to never lose height while switching characters.

There's a [tier list](#Character-tier-lists) further below detailing which characters are the best for infinite jumping.

This trick doesn't have many other limitations besides that it can't be done with all teams and sometimes musou costs put a hard cap on how high you can jump.

Also, this trick doesn't exist in original WO3 since it doesn't have air specials.

### Save and quit infinite jump

If you save & quit in air, upon reloading you end up at same aerial coordinates but with a completely neutral character. In other words, if you have some air attack that gives your character positive height, you can keep saving & reloading while repeating the attack to gain infinite height.

This is the only way to infinite jump with only a single character. On PS3 and PS4 the loading times are slow enough that it's generally not worth using in runs, but it might be a different story on PC.

It's untested whether this glitch works in the original WO3. If it does, there's a good chance that it's the only way to do an infinite jump in that game.

### Horse high jump

One small quality-of-life improvement added in WO3U is being able to sprint off with your horse immediately as you begin mounting it instead of having to wait for your character's mounting animation to complete. However, it turns out that this innocuous detail actually allows a unique high jump tactic.

If you immediately do a horse jump as you are mounting your horse, your character gains to access some inputs that are normally disabled in air. The most obvious use for this is being able to dismount mid-air to gain some unintended height. This can be done with any character to universally gain a fair amount of height with a simple setup. It seems you gain slightly more height if you do this trick with the special horses (e.g. Red Hare) since they are taller and jump higher.

You can also use the exploit to switch characters, block or do horseback attacks during a horse jump, but so far I haven't noticed any particularly devastating effects from any of this. Any horseback attacks appear to cancel upon landing from the jump. Using TTA during this time is not possible. Doing a Samurai-style musou in air works normally, but a Dynasty-style musou interrupts the jump and immediately returns the horse back to the ground level. If done over water surface, you become fully submerged temporarily, which looks funny.

This trick doesn't work in the original WO3 since you can't run or jump with your horse as you are mounting it.

### Wallzipping

If you do an air attack as soon as possible after a jump while right next to certain walls or objects, your character may suddenly acquire a lot of vertical momentum. This momentum becomes fixed to their current air attack, making the character rapidly ascend as long as the attack animation continues.

This is one of the fastest ways to gain height in this game. However, there's a lot of randomness involved with it, which means that it's mostly relevant for individual level categories and not full game runs.

First of all, this glitch is much more likely to occur at a low frame rate. So if you want to try it on PC, keep vsync at 30.

Secondly, characters who can buff their own animation speed have a noticeable advantage. For instance, Zhang He who has buffed his own speed can get wallzips to occur at a much higher rate compared to other characters who do not have a speed buff.

Thirdly, certain pieces of collision or arrangements of level objects can greatly increase the chance of a wallzip. For instance, there's a nearly guaranteed wallclimb location in Luoyang if you position your character in between one of the opened palace doors and the nearby large pots. It seems tight spaces are generally good for doing wallzips.

There's a [tier list](#Character-tier-lists) further down listing which characters are the best at wallzipping.

This glitch works in the original WO3 too, but it's more difficult to take advantage of since there are no air specials and you can only do a limited height wallzip that can't be chained into further air attacks.

### Xu Shu high jump

Xu Shu's launcher (C2) is potentially quite buggy. If it misses contact with an enemy because of distance, Xu Shu will glide upwards a fairly long distance. This is potentially an even faster way to gain height than wallzipping, but it always requires an enemy to perform and seems somewhat inconsistent. The height you receive also seems somewhat random. Having some height difference between you and the enemy may make doing it slightly easier.

I first saw this trick in gmptdgtm's runs on Twitter; the credits probably go to him.

## Speed movement

- [Xiahou Yuan speed tech](#Xiahou-Yuan-speed-tech)
- [Horse boosting](#Horse-boosting)
- [Wang Yi zipping](#Wang-Yi-zipping)
- [Xu Shu speed tech](#Xu-Shu-speed-tech)
- [Zuo Ci speed tech](#Zuo-Ci-speed-tech)

### General advice

This game has a speed cap of 360. Although you can use upgrade stone duping to get a character all the way to 500 Speed, I haven't noticed any circumstances where this makes a difference compared to having 360 Speed. Some characters are able to use some kind of a technique to bypass the speed cap. Of course, this is extremely valuable in speedruns, and the best methods for doing so will be listed below.

As a general rule, if you're not playing on a NG+ save file with maxed out characters, a horse is your best option for fast movement. A horse has a 200 base Speed, whereas the highest natural Speed of all your characters is only 170 (Sun Wukong). Some characters have specific techniques to go even faster than 200 Speed, but only a handful (like Xiahou Yuan) can replace a horse in runs without any set-up.

If using a horse or one of those naturally speedy characters is not an option, your next best option would be to use a Speed-character and double jump everywhere. This is a guaranteed way to move at a 170-180 Speed everywhere. Some characters can also extend their double jump with a good air attack to gain a small extra benefit.

You can also speed up some naturally slow Technique characters by side- or backstepping everywhere, but using a horse should in most cases be more helpful.

### Speed buffing

Some characters - most notably Zhang He and Xiahou Ba - have a special move which significantly boosts - doubles? - the speed of all their actions for a short time. Zhang He can buff his own speed with his air special, whereas Xiahou Ba can do an identical speed buff with his ground special.

Besides making all combat much faster, the speed buff even affects general navigation animations like swimming or climbing ladders. As mentioned above, a speed buff also makes [wallzipping](#Wallzipping) easier to perform.

Speed buffing is a useful tactic in full game speedruns since you get access to it fairly early on (Chapter 2) and it allows you to consistently move at over 200+ Speed. As long as you just have musou to spare, Zhang He alone can obsolete your horse. However, this tactic has diminishing results later on since the maximum benefit you can get from a speed buff is restricted by the universal speed cap.

There is a way to increase your average speed over the speed cap while speed buffed, and that is to do running jumps everywhere. This only saves milliseconds and makes navigation rather bumpy, but it's still a small benefit to keep jumping every time you are speed buffed, whether you're at maxed out Speed or not.

Xiahou Ba is somewhat less effective compared to Zhang He since he starts with a lower base Speed (125), and his ground special is both costlier and slower to perform than Zhang He's air special. However, Zhang He can't be used for speed buffing in the original WO3, since that game doesn't have air specials.

### Benkei speed tech

This is one of the game's fastest movement tactics. It breaks the speed cap and can be done nearly universally - all you need is Benkei with a maxed out Speed and a weapon with Agility 10.

This trick relies on Benkei's air special which makes him leap into the air and then dig underground for around 4 seconds. While digging, Benkei moves at his usual base Speed, but the attack also gains a percentage-based speed bonus from Agility 10, therefore allowing Benkei to bypass the speed cap. Each dig is followed by a short cooldown, but you can skip most of it with a character switch. It's a bit of a bother, but this saves a second or two per use.

Benkei is also immune to water and slippery collision while digging, allowing him to move quickly even through challenging terrain.

This movement tactic is more situational on PS4 because it only works at low frame rate. On PC, you can do it everywhere with vsync 30.

This glitch does not exist in the original WO3 since it doesn't have air specials.

I'm not sure who originally discovered this trick. I first read about it on GameFAQs many years ago.

**Videos:**\
1, AKheon's example of using this trick at Battle of Tong Gate:\
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCkf_ogm3ro

### Xiahou Yuan speed tech

This is another near-universal way to move faster than the speed cap. To do it, you need to have unlocked Xiahou Yuan. It helps if he has a Speed of 360 and Agility 10 on his weapon, but you can get surprisingly good results even without any set-up.

This trick relies on a [neutral L-stick bug](#Neutral-L-stick-bugs). Xiahou Yuan's regular air attack has buggy physics, and it will build up momentum exponentially (up to a certain limit) if you just keep L-stick neutral. To try this out, do a running jump, then quickly let go of L-stick and do his regular air attack. You can see Xiahou Yuan build up some glitchy momentum as long as he stays in air and you don't touch the L-stick.

It's nearly impossible to do this movement tactic optimally every single jump because of its strange input. It doesn't help that most Dynasty-characters have a [run cycle oddity](#Dynasty-running-cycle-bug) that makes them gain a lot of Speed during the first frame or two after they start running, and this movement tactic can also benefit from it.

As mentioned, this tactic works surprisingly well even with a completely vanilla Xiahou Yuan. This makes it useful in many run categories, especially in the original WO3, where this may very well be the fastest way to move on foot in the absence of Benkei's speed digging. Plus it doesn't cost any musou to use either.

Like Benkei's speed tech, this movement tactic only works at low frame rates, making it inconsistent on PS4. But it works 100% consistently on PC with vsync 30.

**Videos:**\

### Horse boosting

If you have three Thrift-characters on your team, you can endlessly spam Musou while on horse and move at a speed that nearly equals Benkei. Having Belt of Concentration to regenerate your Musou is optional but it makes performing the trick a bit smoother.

Although this tactic allows moving faster than the speed cap, it's somewhat more situational and less effective compared to the above speed tactics. For one, it requires you to have a very specific team of characters with S-rank in Thrift. It requires you to be on horseback, so it can't be used indoors. Potentially having to dismount/mount your horse every once in a while also adds some extra steps to doing this speed movement.

But this trick has some unique benefits as well. It doesn't rely on frame rate, making it 100% consistent even on console or vsync 60. Horse boosting also becomes comparatively more powerful if you can get Winged Boots to drop from enemies.

You should unlock Red Hare or Matsukaze for horse boosting since these horses have a higher base Speed (250), increasing the effectiveness of their boost.

This tactic also works in the original WO3, where it ranks among one of the best movement tactics available.

### Wang Yi zipping

This trick relies on a neutral L-stick bug. If you do Wang Yi's regular air attack high in air while keeping L-stick neutral, her air momentum starts building exponentially. Eventually she will zip forward at such a high velocity that she can potentially even end up outside the level boundaries.

The effect is different depending on your frame rate. At higher frame rates, the trick is more controllable and it only sends you flying forward at an extremely high speed. At low frame rate, your speed increases past all comprehension and your coordinates may end up wrapping (?), causing Wang Yi to essentially teleport somewhere with a small degree of randomness.

This is without a doubt the single fastest movement tactic in the game - it's so fast that it literally breaks the game's physics. It's difficult to control, but being able to go nearly instantly from spot A to spot B can be very handy in speedruns. This is also the only known way to teleport past level boundaries, which is a rather unique utility.

Unfortunately the high difficulty and randomness of this trick makes it mostly relevant for individual level runs. You also need a lot of height to really make use of the exponential speed gain.

This trick DOES work in the original WO3, but it's much harder to set up since your ways of gaining height are so limited.

**Videos:**\
1, AKheon's video of using this trick at Battle of Yiling:\
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMgljUYorw4

### Xu Shu speed tech

This trick is reliant on a neutral L-stick bug. Xu Shu's first charge attack (C1) causes a dash towards any enemy on contact. This is quite a unique attack that temporarily gives you a very high speed before automatically seguing into a double jump. If you perform Xu Shu's air charge attack and keep L-stick neutral frame precisely at the start of the double jump, the attack will use the extremely high velocity of the preceding dash instead of the usually capped double jump velocity. This makes you fly forward for a few seconds at a velocity that not only breaks the speed cap but is also much faster than Benkei's speed digging.

Unfortunately, this tactic is quite difficult to use for multiple reasons. For one, C1 itself is not entirely consistent. Possibly because of level geometry-related reasons, sometimes a double jump doesn't happen as expected at the end of the attack. Executing the trick and gaining high speed afterwards is also extremely precise. You can't do this trick without the help of an enemy. Furthermore, you can't steer during the speedy movement and you also lose your velocity if you bump into any other enemies or walls on the way, which limits the utility and consistency of the trick even further.

I'm not certain if this tactic requires a low frame rate to work.

This trick doesn't exist in the original WO3 since Xu Shu was only added as a playable character in WO3U.

I first saw this trick in gmptdgtm's runs on Twitter; the credits probably go to him.

**Videos:**\
1, AKheon's demo:\
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQpd9hFCiyg

### Zuo Ci speed tech

This trick relies on a neutral L-stick bug. If you do Zuo Ci's air special with L-stick neutral, you get far more speed than intended and move at a velocity that easily breaks the speed cap as long as you stay in air. Having Agility 10 on your weapon makes the tactic even more powerful.

This tactic is fairly situational. First of all, you need more than a single jump's worth of height to make the most out of your buggy momentum. You also lose the super speed if you touch the L-stick or Zuo Ci brushes any walls at any point. This means you can't really steer while doing this tech, and it's not practical to use in tight spaces either.

Getting super speed also requires a low frame rate. Although it's inconsistent on PS4, it can be done reliably on PC with vsync 30. You get a bit of extra speed to this attack by keeping L-stick neutral even on vsync 60, but it's not quite as much.

This movement tactic does not exist in regular WO3 because it doesn't have air specials.

### Yoshitsune Minamoto speed tech

Imagine Zuo Ci's fast movement tech, except with Yoshitsune's air special. This one doesn't require keeping L-stick neutral, though. Agility on weapon makes it more effective.

It's harder to move long distances with this attack since it descends faster than Zuo Ci's air special, even if the speed is equally impressive. The attack is also less flexible than Zuo Ci's air special since you can't steer at all during it.

Getting super speed requires a low frame rate. Therefore, it's inconsistent on PS4 but can be done reliably on PC with vsync 30.

This movement tactic does not exist in regular WO3 because it doesn't have air specials.

### Pang Tong fast movement

Pang Tong has a very mobile air special that lets him propel through the air at a high speed. This is likely the fourth fastest way to move through air, almost certainly exceeding the speed cap. Agility helps make it even more effective.

This movement tactic's main advantage is maneuverability, since you can steer quite freely while doing Pang Tong's air special.

This movement tactic does not exist in regular WO3 because it doesn't have air specials.

## Seimei Abe / Sanzang fast movement

Seimei Abe and Sanzang have an air charge attack that turns them into a glider for a time. This is likely the fifth fastest way to move in air. Both Agility and maxed out base speed make it more effective.

The main advantages of this movement tactic are its floatiness and maneuverability. These two characters descend really slow, so this tactic can be useful if you need to preserve your height over a long distance while f.e. navigating a specific path.

Seimei Abe can get a bit more height to his glide by doing jump -> regular air attack -> charge air attack. He also falls down faster after you are done gliding. Both of these things in my opinion make him the better choice in speedruns.

Seimei Abe was only added in WO3U, which means Sanzang is the only character you can do this tactic with in the original WO3.

### Neutral L-stick bugs

A number of air attacks in this game have buggy physics and they gain additional momentum if you keep L-stick neutral. Sometimes this effect is barely noticeable, but sometimes it makes your character's speed increase exponentially, resulting in incredibly fast movement. The most useful cases of neutral L-stick bugs are listed below, and more will be listed in the character-specific section... eventually, once it's written.

### Dynasty running cycle bug

All characters based on Dynasty Warriors-mechanics possess this small yet beneficial bug. When these characters begin their run cycle, their Speed is much higher than it should be during the first frame or two - not quite Speed cap levels, but close.

If you jump precisely at this time, you get to carry over this extra Speed in air. In practice, this allows a universal fast movement tactic with any Dynasty-character if you just do running jumps repeatedly at a precise timing. It's difficult to get perfectly consistent, but on average it should still speed up a character with a low base Speed and no double jump. It's pretty obscure, but might still be worth knowing.

This small oddity doesn't seem to happen at all with Samurai-style characters.

## Other tech

- [Angled glitch](#Angled-glitch)
- [TTA-related mechanics glitch](#TTA-related-mechanics-glitch)

### Angled glitch

This is a glitch that impacts your character's z-axis so that they gain a slight forward angle. As a side effect, your character sinks into the ground while doing attacks, especially attacks with lengthy, non-looping animations that feature a lot of forward movement.

This can be a faster alternative to infinite jumping, and it comes in handy in many places around the game. However, you need a ladder to start this glitch, so you can't do it in every level.

Not every character has attacks that are suitable for going under walls. Besides that, some walls are "thicker" than others and harder to breach. Thin garrison gates are the easiest walls to go under, whereas regular garrison walls are usually considered thick, and can only be breached by a handful of characters.

Having more Agility on your weapon apparently makes it slightly harder to go under walls.

There are two ways to start this glitch, but both require at the very least a ladder. First setup has you breaking out of the ladder with a Samurai-style musou. First, bring a Samurai-style character near a ladder. Start their Musou, get on a ladder and then let the timer of the Musou run out. At the end, the character will break out of the ladder climb, keeping the angle that they had while on the ladder.

Another way to do a ladder break-out is to activate TTA while on a ladder. This allows you to use angled glitch with a larger variety of different teams, since you don't need to worry about having a Samurai-style character with you at all times.

In some circumstances the TTA-setup might even be faster than a Samurai-musou setup, since certain characters like Wang Yuanji with a Confluence-weapon can get a full TTA-bar in just under a second by hitting a large crowd of enemies. However, as a drawback, when you use TTA on ladder, the TTA mode becomes active and you then need to find a way to end TTA early (with water, angled floor or a cutscene) or suffer a huge time loss when the TTA-timer runs out and you get that big flashy finishing blow cutscene.

There's a tier list further below detailing which characters are best at angled wall breaching.

This glitch DOES work in the original Warriors Orochi 3.

**Videos:**\
1, AKheon's video:\
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWWu6AsrHUU

### TTA related mechanics glitch

This is an esoteric mechanics glitch that is fairly hard to put into words. It seems to split character model & data into two separate entities whenever you do attacks, causing various odd side effects.

To start this glitch, you need a full TTA-bar, your horse and either deep water or slippery floor that is *available at ground level*. Getting a full TTA-bar is not a problem if you can just use a Confluence-weapon, but the second requirement makes the setup for this glitch quite specialized. It also doesn't help that the timing for the glitch is nearly frame-precise, so it's not exactly effortless to pull off like angled glitch.

Instructions: get a full TTA-bar. Get on your horse. Ride into deep water or slippery floor and activate TTA at precisely the correct time. This should start the glitch.

This trick has a number of very peculiar effects, although sadly, most of them are quite fringe and I'm not sure how useful they could be in speedruns:

- characters with lengthy "dash" attacks (f.e. Yukimura Sanada) can propel themselves backwards near walls, in the process becoming able to damage targets or hit triggers through walls.

- every character can start doing sloped floor clipping completely effortlessly, especially characters with lengthy "dash" attacks. The effect is particularly unique at tall cliffs that are covered in slippery collision, as you can project your character through them and then zip upwards to ground level for super fast "mountain climbing". The same mechanism probably also allows you to go under walls that are near a downwards incline.

- Yukimura Sanada's air special seemingly teleports him from point A to point B, which might allow him to teleport past triggers.

- every character can generate an immense amount of speed by jumping frame-precisely after most of their attacks. Lengthy "dash" type attacks give more speed. You can fly from one side of the level to the other with a proper setup, but sadly, the walls are made of such sturdy stuff that even a speed as high as this hasn't helped in wall clipping.

- you can clip through non-sloped floor if there's a ledge right next to it behind a wall. Might be helpful in some elevated indoors area somewhere?

This glitch didn't exist in the original Warriors Orochi 3 since you couldn't use TTA on horseback in it.

### Attacking through walls

Some characters have attacks that can reach enemies from behind the walls. In case breaching into some enemy stronghold early is not an option, simply sniping enemies through the walls can be a good alternative in speedruns. So far, the best characters to do this with are Nezha (Human) and Xiahou Dun.

Some characters like Xiahou Yuan, Guo Jia and Gyuki have an air special that shoots a downwards aerial projectile at a fairly steep angle. This projectile goes through walls and has an effectively near-infinite range, only exploding upon hitting the ground. Although potentially powerful, you need a lot of height if you plan on using these attacks for hitting targets through walls at long distance.

It's untested if this glitch works in original WO3. If it does, it's bound to be less effective as a tactic since the best methods of attacking through walls don't exist in that version.

**Videos:**\
1, AKheon's video example of doing this in Battle of Nanjun:\
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3EqbtcYUO8

### Garrison gate clip

There is a recurring garrison gate asset in WO3U that has a gap to its side, allowing you to clip through it from either side. The difficulty of doing this varies depending on the area, but it's usually not too hard.

To go from outside to inside, you usually have to be on foot. Get a character with a high base speed, then repeatedly attempt to run through the side of the gate. Press L1 repeatedly at a certain rhythm to stop and start running again and again, this should work. Most attacks that move your character at a high speed also work for doing this clip, but those are more situational and hard to use in my opinion.

To go from inside to outside, you need a horse. Direct a horse to the corner of the gate, get a good angle and use a horse musou boost.

Some applications of the garrison clip do not work in the original WO3, for whatever reason. I've never seen the version where you go from outside to inside work, although inside to outside using horse musou boosting can work. Perhaps the collision of the gate is different?

### Sloped floor clip pt. 1 - special attack bug

There are a few ways to go through sloped floor (like staircases) in this game. One of the easiest yet at the same time most elusive methods is an esoteric bug present in a few of this game's special attacks. Interrupting an ongoing action with a buggy special attack, your character will immediately "zip" to the direction opposite to where they were travelling, essentially quite close to their original starting location. This lets you move your character up to 3 meters in only a frame or two, although to get a full benefit from this glitch, you need a long "dash"-type attack (longer projected movement means a larger zip) as well as good timing.

All the known attacks for this purpose are Taigong Wang's ground special, Motonari Mori's air special, Kotaru Fuma's air special and the horse Musou. Taigong Wang is the easiest to utilize. For instance, do his sprint attack but interrupt it before it's over with ground special. This makes Taigong Wang zip backwards maybe a length of 2 meters. If you do this while running down stairs, you will sink into floor while at it.

Motonari Mori and Kotaru Fuma are slightly different and arguably harder to use since all of their zip-compatible ground moves have to cancel into their air special. So, while f.e. Motonari Mori can overall zip a longer distance than Taigong Wang, he also rises a little higher in air while zipping, thus making it harder to actually pass through floor. This also means you cannot use Motonari Mori or Kotaru Fuma to zip in the original WO3, since it didn't have air specials.

As for doing this trick with the horse: the animation in which the horse gradually slows down after a sprint can be used for backwards zipping if you use Musou during it. Although it's quite easy to clip through sloped floor by doing this, staying out of bounds can be hard because the horse will soon sprint forward, leaving its spot under the sloped floor. To prevent this, save & quit lets you keep your coordinates out of bounds, and the horse stays there as well.

Most attacks in the game project forward, and thus interrupting them with a buggy special attack zips your character backwards. However, Motonari Mori is able to project backwards and thus zip forward with his C3 combo. Categorically it seems to be almost the same thing, however.

In rare situations, like if you're squeezed between an open gate and a wall, it's possible to use a buggy special zip to breach the gate. Perhaps this tactic would work as a general gate clip in some rare situations, but so far it doesn't seem to work very consistently, and it doesn't seem like you can use a horse to create an artificial cramped space for clipping through gates either. At any rate, this potential application needs a bit more research.

### Sloped floor clip part 2 - high velocity

Any character who can acquire a high enough velocity is able to sink into and eventually breach sloped floor. The number of characters who are able to do this is actually fairly large! Having Agility on your weapon makes it more consistent and easier, as Agility increases the effective speed your character has during attacks.

Jia Xu's C1 makes him almost immediately zip forward over 2 meters. Especially with Agility 10, this becomes an incredibly useful tool for sloped floor clipping of most types. He can breach your typical steep sloped floor like the stairs at Nanzhong as well as shorter and less steep stairs like the ones at Anegawa or Honnoji. The fact that he projects a decent distance forward while doing this also means that he can potentially zip under smaller gates that are uphill.

Xiahou Yuan has a rather unique sloped floor clipping utility. His bugged regular air attack allows him to easily get a huge speed while flying forward near ground level. This lets him clip through even just very mildly sloped floor that no other character is able to clip, f.e. the various mildly inclined walkways in Escape from the Mirror Realm. However, it should be noted that this game has an esoteric mechanism where certain aspects of your character's speed become capped to around 150 when over staircases or slippery floor. This affects Xiahou Yuan's regular air attack as well, which means that although he is masterful at sloped floor clipping in general, he can't clip through actual staircases particularly well. C5 can help with clipping steep staircases, but that's about it.

You can also breach sloped floor using Ryu Hayabusa and Ayane. Both of these characters have a slightly glitchy air charge attack where they sink inside the floor a little bit upon landing. Simply run towards the stairs, do an air charge attack close to ground level and hope you clip through. A high base Speed and having Agility on your weapon seems to help.

Other characters who are able to achieve high enough speed to sloped floor clip include Hanzo Hattori (air special), Liu Shan (C3 combo), Sima Shi (C3 combo), Kasumi (C1 combo) and Zhao Yun (ground special). There are possibly more.

### Sloped floor clip part 3 - clipping with mounts

Simply leaving your mount standing on sloped floor and then pushing against it from below at high speed can give you additional leverage for clipping through. The "ceiling" provided by the collision of your mount lets you to clip sloped floor without needing such a high velocity as you normally would, this giving new characters access to sloped floor clips. This can be done with any of your mounts, but elephant and bear are easier than the horse in my opinion.

The bear is particularly unique. With some setups, all you need to do to clip through steep sloped floor is to run against the bear at a high speed. This means that essentially any character with a high enough running speed can now do sloped floor clip, making this rather esoteric trick much more accessible for a larger variety of different teams.

With bear or elephant, dismounting while the mount's back-left side is against some collision like a railing can also create a sloped floor breach. You can use the repelling force of the railing and the mount to "zip" you at a high enough speed upstairs that you clip through the floor. The positioning is easier to do with characters like Momiji and Hundun who leap a maximally long distance away from the mount when dismounting. Bear is much easier for this kind of a clip than elephant since elephant is a much taller mount.

### Sloped floor clip part 4 - general info

Although quite a rich and storied glitch, the sloped floor clip unfortunately has a rather selective use in speedruns. You need to find the correct type of geometry for it, for instance a floor with a 45 degree angle. For certain types of clips like Taigong Wang's backward zips, there also needs to be a second layer of floor underneath. Otherwise, your character is simply returned back on ground level after the clip, and nothing is gained from the clip.

Any velocity-based sloped floor clip becomes easier to use with a lower frame rate. Therefore, if you want to try this stuff out, keep vsync at 30.

Many of the principles here should work in other Warriors-games from this era too. F.e. the horse Musou backwards zip has been proven to exist in Dynasty Warriors 7 as well.

Since the original Warriors Orochi 3 did not have infinite jumping or easily accessible wallclimb, sloped floor clip might be more useful in that game to f.e. do some unique shortcuts in levels like Anegawa or Honnoji.

### Delayed input glitch

This is an obscure trick with mostly theoretical use that works at least in Dynasty Warriors 7 and this title.

As you know, all the characters/weapons in these games have their own canned combo strings that consist of regular attacks and charge attacks. But if you avoid tapping buttons and instead give precise input at the last possible moment, your character's attack animations will look much more janky than usual. So what's up with that?

Each character's combo animations run at a set timer. No matter how fast or slow you press buttons, the next attack in a combo always starts at a specific frame. If you avoid tapping buttons and instead only give one precise input as late as possible, the game does not get an early signal to seamlessly switch between attack animations. The new animation will instead start instantly with some frames dropped at the start so that it will still fit the general timing scheme of the combo string.

These dropped frames cause the janky looking effect, and occasionally they may cause other effects too. In Dynasty Warriors 7, doing combos with delayed input can cause projectiles to not fire. Curved sword combos also happen with the sword sheathed, although that is strictly a graphical effect. I haven't noticed this kind of miscellaneous effects in WO3U, though, other than projectiles disappearing with some characters when giving delayed input on horseback.

Small zips are also a possible result. Your character's relative position is adjusted at the start of each attack to where they're supposed to be at that point in the combo string. So if there is an attack which features a lot of movement and lenient buffers make it drop many frames, your character will be moved from spot A to spot B with no interpolation - as if zipping. Very large zips would let your character breach sloped floor, although this is a strictly theoretical application so far.

Due to how input buffering works in this game, it's possible to buffer something like two regular attacks (S1 -> S2) and still lead into second charge attack (C2) in the same combo. With some characters like Wang Yuanji and Zhenji, with precise timing the buffered S2 actually hits enemies before C2 starts, allowing you to do an S1 -> S2 -> C2 combo and increase your DPS slightly compared to just doing S1 -> C2. To do this, press 'regular attack' twice at a quick succession, then 'charge attack' at last possible moment after S2 has already started.

As another obscure detail, if you instead do the above example by first pressing 'regular attack', then 'regular attack' -> 'charge attack' at a quick succession during the last possible moment, your character will start S2 which is interrupted by C2 which does NOT drop frames. So, in practice, the attack comes out with a maybe 10 frame delay compared to normal. So even though I said earlier that all the game's combo strings always run at a set timer, this actually does objectively delay the timer and the timing of the next attack. But could such a subtle detail matter, even in high-level gameplay...?

### Escort mission time saves

You can speed up escort missions by pushing the escort NPC around instead of waiting for them to run to their destination. You can do this on foot, but it's generally recommended to use a horse for this purpose since they have a slightly wider collision. Red Hare is bigger and faster than a regular horse, and probably your best option for NPC pushing, although it can be difficult to do an extended push since NPCs tend to slip past your horse quite easily.

This trick only works when the NPC is in "navigation" mode, i.e. they're intentionally trying to head for a specific destination. Stationary NPCs resist attempts to move them, and they soon run back to their original location if you move them more than a few meters.

There are some areas in the game where NPCs have a hard time moving around. They may constantly get stuck on doorways or collision, wasting a lot of time. In a situation like this, it might not be worth it to try pushing the NPC. Better option might be to move away from them and look away - being off-camera makes an NPC move towards their destination without getting stuck as much.

Replacing an escort character with their generic officer variant, f.e. turning Ma Chao into Ma Teng in Breakthrough in Yiling, seems to be a bad idea. It seems generic officers all have an abysmal running speed, probably somewhere in the 100-110 range. At any rate, they always seem to run slower than even the slowest of your playable characters.

# Tips for preparing your save file

Getting your characters in a perfect shape requires a lot of grinding, there's just no way around that. However, there are several things you can do to speed up the process.

## Gauntlet-Mode is the key

This is an infinitely replayable mode where it's very easy to get experience. There are also a ton of unique resources you can't get in any other modes, such as ingredients from which you can craft orbs and unique 5-star weapons for each character. Doing this mode is the key to building the perfect characters.

Every time you replay Gauntlet-mode, you unlock new type of levels (as indicated by their color in the level select-screen). The only difference between level types is that later levels start with a higher miasma; this can speed up grinding since certain good items drop more frequently (or: can only drop?) on higher miasma levels.

## Starting out

It all starts from having decent level characters who can survive for extended periods of time on Gauntlet-mode.

When starting out with weak characters, try to stay inside levels a fairly short amount of time since difficulty escalates quickly as the Miasma level grows. Use a formation that has "Dem. Eye" (or later "Getaway") to find the exit portal quickly when needed.

Search for purple portals to get experience fast. Gaining a lot of experience awards a lot of growth points afterwards too, which is also a big help to leveling up your characters. Focus on getting a single character to lv. 100 first. Lv. 100 is a game changer, because this is when you can promote them and start using upgrade stones.

Out of the regular Gauntlet-mode starting characters, Zhou Yun is the best for grinding experience with. While he runs slower than Hanzo Hattori, he can be a real beast at taking down large groups of enemies. Try spamming the air special (jump cancelling in between uses) to destroy hundreds of troops in seconds.

As an additional tip for survival, try to form a team with a lot of Thrift-type characters, since having them around makes it easier to spam specials or Musou. Stay on the lookout for Thrifty people! For the record, all the characters with Thrift are Liu Shan, Motochika Chosokabe, No, Zhang Jiao, Xu Shu, Dong Zhuo, Nene, Hundun, Yinglong, Ayane, Mitsuhide Akechi, Wei Yan and Liu Bei. Some of them only unlock Thrift after you have promoted them.

## After getting your first lv. 100 character

The game has a promotion exploit that allows you to hand out promotions to any character as soon as you just have a single character who can be promoted. To do this, enter the promotion menu, place cursor on your lv. 100 character, then quickly press up or down at the same time as you press 'X' (or equivalent) to affirm. Done correctly, the "are you sure?" sub-menu opens up, but the graphics in the background change to display the wrong character. If you now choose 'yes', the wrong character will get promoted. The original character stays at lv. 100, and so this can be repeated indefinitely.

Meanwhile, upgrade stones are a way to enhance stats beyond the normal limit. The same menu glitch works with upgrade stones as well, allowing you to dupe them at will. Put cursor on a character who has a lot of upgrade stones, then press 'X' (or equivalent) at the same time as you press up or down. This will dupe all the upgrade stones to the other promoted character.

This is also an easy way to get your speed to the maximum speed cap, which is 360. Normally you can't boost your character's speed more than 180 / 200 (depending on their promotion level) with upgrade stones. However, if you put the cursor on a low speed character, then do the same menu glitch again, the game assumes your second character's speed is in fact the first character's low speed, and therefore doesn't restrict you as much.

It's much faster to play Gauntlet-mode with a bunch of maximum speed, maximum stat characters compared to doing things the regular way! Although, having good weapons is actually more significant than having max stats as far as dealing damage goes. On that same note...

## Acquiring 5-star weapons

The Gauntlet-mode shop is trash; you'll never unlock decent weapons there. To get good weapons to start with, it's recommended to play Story-mode up to later chapters (like Chapter 4) and use the Story-mode shop to purchase yourself 4-star weapons.

Unlocking 5-star weapons is a painful grind. To get the right ingredients, you have to defeat famous officers at a high miasma level so that they may randomly drop their personal item. You need at least two for any 5-star weapon. You can see the names of the officers who will appear in any given level from the level select-menu if you want to go hunting for these items.

It might be worth it maxing out a big-star weapon for some Thrift-character to get a big early boost to your attack power. Hanging out in high miasma fights tends to drop some weapons that have a boosted innate power; with any luck, you can replace big-star and 4-star weapons pretty soon with a dropped weapon and that way increase your effectiveness while waiting for those 5-star weapons to arrive. Ultimately, there is no alternative to 5-star weapons that you've hand-crafted and set-up yourself.

Try to unlock Mystic Bells so that dropped items are vacuumed towards your character so that you don't miss anything in the heat of fighting.

## Useful weapon traits?

In short, anything that boosts damage: Brawn, Might, Frenzy, Blast, Aerial, etc. depending on what type of damage you're planning on doing with the character.

Agility increases all weapon attack speeds. It's a must for speedrunning; not only does it increase your damage-per-second, but it also helps with the speed of any movement technique that is based around attacks, f.e. Benkei's or Pang Tong's air specials.

Osmosis is a life-saver if you decide to break Gauntlet-mode with a Samurai-style Thrift character like No. Start your musou to become invulnerable and keep supplying yourself with infinite energy by doing a charge attack every now and then, simple as that.

Alacrity gives you a health & musou refill at every 500-hit combo, which again completely breaks Gauntlet-mode if you have a Samurai-style character who can generate a lot of combo, f.e. Motonari Mori.

Bombast is similar, giving you some free musou-energy every 500 hits of a combo. If you are playing as a character who has good specials and can generate combo easily, this can make them nearly invulnerable.

Aggression gives the helpful War God's Axe (i.e. attack buff) effect every 200 hits. You won't reach 200 hits in most levels while doing individual level runs, but it's definitely useful when grinding.

Procurement in your weapon duplicates all item drops all of the time, which essentially cuts the grind short by half. Incredibly useful to have.

## Building up compatibility

After you have a 5-star weapon, it's only at a third or so of its full power. To get a hefty +99 damage bonus to it, you have to use it in combat. A lot.

The process of building up compatibility is easier with characters who have massive, deadly area of effect attacks, like Xiahou Dun with his air special. Some characters don't have this luxury, making their grind feel that much grindier.

To speed up the accumulation of weapon exp, get Harmony on your weapon. Besides that, there are a few characters who have Expertise as a passive skill - keeping them in your party will also speed up the rate at which you gain weapon exp. These characters are Gyuki, Momiji, Rachel and Da Ji.

But still, even in the best case scenario, building up weapon exp is very, very slow indeed... Plan ahead on who you're going to use in individual level runs and upgrade selectively to save some time.

## Building up skills

Developing your characters' passive skills such as Thrift is similar but somewhat faster than building up weapon experience. You should generally get S-rank skills by the time you've finished building up your 5-star weapon too. If you got problems with building up skills, you could always try putting Industry on your weapon or getting characters with Aptitude (i.e. Dodomeki or Gyuki) on your team.

## Anything else?

You can also get some unique gear from Gauntlet-mode. You might not strictly need these items for NG+ speedruns, but they can't hurt. Belt of Concentration (continuous Musou regen) helps with some tactics, for instance.

Playing through Story-mode is necessary to unlock all the levels. Some individual levels also can make use of Matsukaze or Red Hare, so those are helpful to unlock as well.

# Selecting your team

## Helpful skills

- Efficacy

Efficacy increases damage inflicted upon enemy officers. This skill doesn't influence character stats; rather, it just seems to increase your raw damage output against officers. This means it works even if your characters already have max stats, and is therefore very useful in categories where you use maxed out characters.

- Vigor

Increases damage inflicted with combo attacks. This is another skill which should influence your raw damage output. Intuitively, I've always thought Efficacy might be more useful in runs since you don't really combo enemies all that much, but I can't say for sure.

- Regeneration

Increases passive Musou regeneration. Might help in situations where you use a lot of Musou, like infinite jumping, but with max stats it's generally not that pertinent.

- Thrift

Thrift reduces all Musou costs, and it has some specific uses in speedruns. If you have a team with three Thrift-characters, doing Musou on horse is so cheap that you can keep spamming it over and over, which is a good, unique fast movement tactic. Thrift is also the main way to break Gauntlet-mode in half.

## Skills that are not useful for NG+ runs:

- Fellowship

Increases damage inflicted with Switch Combos. This skill also influences your raw damage output, but so far I haven't really found an use for Switch Combos in a speedrun.

- Focus, Fortitude, Impulse, Potence, Power, Speed, Technique, Wonder

If your character has max stats already, then these skills do nothing. Otherwise, they can be helpful.

- Bounty, Acclaim

Getting more gems or exp is a part of the grind before the speedrun; no longer pertinent once you have max stats.

- Dexterity, Solidarity

These two are defensive skills. You're not supposed to get hit all that much in a speedrun!

- Impact, Stamina

These two skills grant health or musou back after every 100 KO. They are pretty useful in casual play, but not necessary at all in speedruns.

- Trinity

Building up TTA gauge is generally not useful in runs since using the TTA attack takes so much time. Also, there's no TTA in Gauntlet-mode, so this trait is extra useless there.

# Character tier lists

## Top 5 characters for chainable horizontal air movement:

Yukimura Sanada, Xingcai, Hundun, Jia Xu, Yueying

Note: Zhou Yu's air special is also fast, chainable horizontal air movement, but it destroys your height.

## Top 5 characters for non-chainable horizontal air movement:

Seimei Abe, Sanzang, Pang Tong, Wei Yan, Xu Huang.

Note: Wang Yi's zipping is basically fastest non-chainable aerial movement, but it's quite situational.

Note: Benkei, Zuo Ci and Yoshitsune Minamoto get an honorable mention for their buggy air special speed.

## Top 5 characters for chainable vertical air movement:

Hanzo Hattori, Xingcai, Yuan Shao, Wang Yuanji, Ayane

Note: Kai gets a honorable mention for being pretty similar to Ayane.

Note: Guan Ping is trickier to use since he doesn't have double jump, but his air special gives him a ludicrous amount of height fast.
