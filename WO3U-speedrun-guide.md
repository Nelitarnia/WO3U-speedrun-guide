# Introduction

Hello and welcome to my Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate speedrunning guide. So... why this game in particular?

This may very well be my favorite out of all the Musou-games. It has a great roster, fun glitches and a lot of content. It's absurd and intense. I find it so good that I even forgive some of its grindiness. Sadly, these games are not very popular as speed games, but I hope that will change one day.

## About Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate as a speed game

- The game is overall rather stable, and I've only seen it crash a few times in the years I've played it.

- The game doesn't have a lot of downtime. All cutscenes can be skipped and loading times aren't too long.

- It has a bunch of stylish looking time saving glitch tactics.

- Full-game runs which aim for the first ending are under 90 minutes long, which isn't too bad.

- Running other, shorter categories is also an option. For instance, individual levels are a lot of fun.

- For individual level runs or other type of NG+ runs, you have to grind to get good characters first.

- Some of the fastest tactics are RNG-heavy, although less so on the PC-version.

- Several levels contain escort missions, which are fairly slow.

# Glitch tech

I've divided the various glitch techniques into the following categories:

- [Jump tech](#Jump-tech). Different methods of gaining unintended height.
- [Speed movement](#Speed-movement). Different methods of fast movement.
- [Other tech](#Other-tech). Other uncategorizable tricks.

But first, a note about frame rate. On PS3 and PS4, the frame rate of the game changes between 30 and 60 fps at random. This is important to note because certain glitch effects can only happen - or work better - when frame rate is lower. The PC version allows the user to set their own frame rate, and setting vsync to 30 forces the game to always be in slower frame rate. In other words, PC is the more reliable platform for running any kind of glitched categories in WO3U. I will make a specific note about which glitches are influenced by vsync in the sections below.

If you see terms that are unfamiliar, check out the [terminology](#Terminology) section.

## Jump tech

Most walls in this game are essentially infinitely high, and there's no hope of jumping past them. However, different kind of doors, gateways and other temporary obstacles have a finite height. So when you're doing these jump tactics, you should always aim for the doorways. Sometimes it can be hard to discern which part of the level design is an infinitely tall outer boundary and which is a gateway. In these cases, looking closer at the map should be helpful, as various kinds of openable doors are marked with a different color.

Note that it's not always possible to tell the height of collision by just looking. Although many garrison gates are exactly as high as they look, some are blocked by additional invisible boundary. You may need to experiment a bit to find out how high something is.

### Basic infinite jump

The basic infinite jump is done by chaining together air specials to gain essentially infinite height and/or horizontal movement in air. Although normally you can only use a single air special while airborne, you can bypass this limitation by switching characters in air.

Not every team member is equally good at infinite jumping. Some characters have an air special which ends in a downsmash, making them unusable for infinite jumps. Many have an air special which lets them at least hover, but they'll need to be paired with a better infinite jumper for the jump to actually go anywhere. Speed-type characters are especially valuable since they can use double jump in between air specials, making it easier to avoid losing height while chaining together jump actions.

As one unfortunate quirk, air specials that are interrupted with a double jump may randomly lose their gained height at the end. This only happens 10-15% of the time, but it still creates a small degree of inconsistency to vertical infinite jumping for most characters. However, there are a few characters (like Xingcai) who can use their air charge attack during an infinite jump to gain additional height which is never lost due to this quirk, which can be highly valuable during longer infinite jumps.

There's a [tier list](#Character-tier-lists) further below detailing which characters are the best for infinite jumping.

This trick doesn't have limitations besides that it can't be done with all teams and sometimes musou costs put a hard cap on how high you can jump.

This trick doesn't exist in the original WO3 since it doesn't have air specials.

### Save and quit infinite jump

If you save & quit in air, upon reloading you end up at same aerial coordinates but with a completely neutral character. In other words, if you have some air attack that gives your character positive height, you can keep saving & reloading and repeat the attack to gain infinite height.

This is the only way to infinite jump with only a single character. On PS3 and PS4 the loading times are slow enough that it's generally not worth using in runs, but it might be a different story on PC.

It's untested whether this glitch works in the original WO3. If it does, there's a good chance that it's the only way to do an infinite jump in that game.

### Horse high jump

One small quality-of-life improvement added in WO3U is the ability to sprint off with your horse while mounting instead of having to wait for the mounting animation to complete first. However, it turns out that this innocuous detail allows a unique high jump tactic.

If you immediately do a horse jump as you begin mounting your horse, your character gains access to some inputs that are normally disabled in air. This includes dismounting, and doing so mid-jump gives you a fair amount of unintended height. This is pretty simple to setup, and it works with every character in the game too.

It seems you gain slightly more height if you do this trick with the special horses (e.g. Red Hare) since they are taller and jump higher.

You can also use the exploit to switch characters, block or do horseback attacks during a horse jump, but so far I haven't noticed any particularly devastating effects from these inputs. Any horseback attacks appear to cancel upon landing from the jump. Using TTA during this time is not possible. Doing a Samurai-style musou in air works normally, but a Dynasty-style musou interrupts the jump and immediately returns the horse back to the ground level. If done over water surface, you become fully submerged for a moment, which looks funny.

This trick doesn't work in the original WO3 since you can't run or jump with your horse as you are mounting it.

### Wallzipping

If you do an air attack as soon as possible after doing a running jump towards certain walls or objects, your character may suddenly acquire a lot of vertical momentum which becomes fixed to their current air attack. This makes the character rapidly ascend as long as the attack animation continues.

This is one of the fastest ways to gain height in this game. However, there's a lot of randomness involved with it, which means that it's mostly relevant for individual level categories and not full game runs.

First of all, this glitch is much more likely to occur at a low frame rate. If you want to try it on PC, keep vsync at 30.

Secondly, characters who can buff their own animation speed have a noticeable advantage. For instance, Zhang He who has buffed his own speed can get wallzips to occur at a much higher rate compared to other characters who do not have a speed buff.

Thirdly, certain pieces of collision or arrangements of level objects can greatly increase the chance of a wallzip. For instance, there's a nearly guaranteed wallclimb location in Luoyang if you position your character in between one of the opened palace doors and the nearby large pots. It seems tight spaces are generally good for doing wallzips.

There's a [tier list](#Character-tier-lists) further down listing which characters are the best at wallzipping.

This glitch works in the original WO3 too, but it's more difficult to take advantage of since there are no air specials - you can only do a limited height wallzip that can't be chained into further air attacks.

### Xu Shu high jump

Xu Shu's launcher (C2) is potentially quite buggy. If it misses contact with an enemy because of distance, Xu Shu will glide upwards a fairly long distance. This is potentially an even faster way to gain height than wallzipping, but it always requires an enemy to perform and seems somewhat inconsistent. The height you receive also seems somewhat random. Having some height difference between you and the enemy may make doing it slightly easier.

I first saw this trick in gmptdgtm's runs on Twitter; the credits probably go to him.

## Speed movement

Speed movement tactics could be generally divided into three different types: ground movement, aerial movement or a hybrid of the two. It's useful to consider all of them when devising the fastest route through a level. For example, in some level it might be useful to start an infinite jump early and then move some distance airborne to get over multiple invisible walls with a single jump.

As a general rule, if you're not playing on a NG+ save file with maxed out characters, a horse is your best option for fast movement. A horse has a 200 base Speed, whereas the highest natural Speed of all your characters is only 170 (Sun Wukong). Some characters have specific techniques to go even faster than 200 Speed, but only a handful (like Xiahou Yuan) can replace a horse in runs without any set-up.

If using a horse or one of those naturally speedy characters is not an option, your next best option would be to use a Speed-type character and double jump everywhere. This is a guaranteed way to move at a 170-180 Speed everywhere. Some characters can also extend their double jump with an air attack to do this slightly more efficiently.

This game has a Speed cap of 360. Although you can use upgrade stone duping to get a character's Speed all the way to 500, I haven't noticed any circumstances where this makes a difference compared to having 360 Speed.

Some characters are able to use some kind of a technique to bypass the Speed cap. Of course, this is extremely valuable in speedruns, and the best methods for doing so (as well as other useful tactics) are listed below.

- [Dynasty running cycle bug](#Dynasty-running-cycle-bug)

### Speed buffing

Some characters - most notably Zhang He and Xiahou Ba - have a powerful special move which doubles the speed of all their actions for a short time. Besides making all combat much faster, this speed buff even affects general navigation animations like swimming or climbing ladders. As mentioned above, a speed buff also makes [wallzipping](#Wallzipping) easier to perform.

Speed buffing is a useful tactic in full game speedruns since you get access to it fairly early on (Chapter 2) and it allows you to consistently move at over 200+ Speed. As long as you just have musou to spare, Zhang He alone can obsolete your horse. However, this tactic has diminishing results later on since the maximum benefit you can get from a speed buff is restricted by the universal Speed cap.

There is a way to increase your average speed over the Speed cap while speed buffed, and that is to do running jumps everywhere. This only saves milliseconds and makes navigation rather bumpy, but it's still mildly beneficial to keep jumping while you are speed buffed, whether you're at maxed out Speed or not.

Xiahou Ba is somewhat less effective compared to Zhang He since he starts with a lower base Speed (125), and his ground special is both costlier and slower to perform than Zhang He's air special. However, Zhang He can't be used for speed buffing in the original WO3, since that game doesn't have air specials.

Other characters like Zhang Liao and Ranmaru Mori can also buff their own speed temporarily, but these speed buffs are generally less powerful and have less utility for speed movement purposes.

### Benkei speed tech

Benkei's air special makes him leap high into the air followed by a quick forward downsmash that leaves him underground in a "digging" state. This action uses Benkei's base Speed and it also gains a percentage-based Speed bonus from Agility 10. Since Agility can give a character up to a 17% attack speed boost, a quick calculation would suggest that the maximum Speed of this movement is 421,2. However, in practice the average Speed is slightly slower than that since the air special does have some cooldown between uses.

It's useful to note that it's not only the grounded digging state which breaks Speed cap but also the aerial downsmash preceding it, so Benkei can fly through the air a very long distance if you set up the right circumstances for it. He can't be steered at all until he hits ground level, though.

Besides being very fast, one huge advantage of Benkei's speed digging is that it's extremely steerable. Although it's a little difficult to control since you move so quick, it's fundamentally a highly responsive movement tactic that you can even use in narrow areas with tight corners with some practice. Benkei is also immune to water and slippery collision while digging, allowing him to move quickly even through challenging terrain.

Each dig is followed by a short cooldown, but you can skip most of it with a character switch. It's a bit of a bother, but this saves a second or two per use.

This movement tactic is incredibly useful in individual level categories, but it's harder to utilize in full game runs - for best results, you first have to setup Benkei with maxed out Speed and Agility 10. It's also very costly as far as musou is concerned if you try relying on it early game.

Benkei speed digging is more situational on PS4 because it only works at low frame rate. You can do it everywhere with vsync 30 on PC.

This glitch does not exist in the original WO3 since it doesn't have air specials.

I'm not sure who originally discovered this trick. I first read about it on GameFAQs many years ago.

### Xiahou Yuan speed tech

This is another near-universal way to move faster than the Speed cap. To do it, you need to have unlocked Xiahou Yuan. It helps if he has a Speed of 360 and Agility 10 on his weapon, but you can get surprisingly good results even without any set-up.

This trick relies on a [neutral L-stick bug](#Neutral-L-stick-bugs). Xiahou Yuan's regular air attack has buggy physics, and it will build up momentum exponentially (up to a certain limit) if you just keep L-stick neutral. To try this out, do a running jump, then quickly let go of L-stick and do his regular air attack. You can see Xiahou Yuan build up some glitchy momentum as long as he stays in air and you don't touch the L-stick.

Timing tests have shown that in optimal conditions this movement tech is faster than Benkei speed digging. However, in practice using Benkei speed digging is often more convenient because it's less terrain-dependent and far more steerable. Xiahou Yuan speed tech only has a strict advantage over Benkei in open spaces or when moving downhill.

Furthermore, it's nearly impossible to do this movement tactic optimally every single time because of its strange input which requires a precise use of L-stick. It doesn't help that most Dynasty-characters have a [run cycle oddity](#Dynasty-running-cycle-bug) that makes them gain a lot of Speed during the first frame or two after they start running, and this movement tactic can also gain or lose a lot of velocity from it.

As mentioned, this tactic works surprisingly well even with a completely vanilla Xiahou Yuan. This makes it useful in many run categories, especially in the original WO3, where it's the fastest way to move on foot in the absence of Benkei's speed digging. Plus, it doesn't cost any musou to use either.

Like Benkei's speed digging, this movement tactic only works at low frame rates, making it inconsistent on PS4. But it works 100% consistently on PC with vsync 30.

### Horse boosting

If you have three Thrift-characters on your team, you can endlessly spam Musou while on horse and move at a speed that nearly equals Benkei. Having Belt of Concentration to regenerate your Musou is optional but it makes performing the trick a bit smoother.

Although this tactic allows moving faster than the Speed cap, it's somewhat more situational and less effective compared to the above tactics. For one, it requires you to have a very specific team of characters with S-rank in Thrift. It requires you to be on horseback, so it can't be used indoors. Potentially having to dismount/mount your horse every once in a while also adds some extra steps to doing this speed movement. And generally, your average Speed is just slightly slower than optimally performed Benkei speed digging.

But this trick has some unique benefits as well. It doesn't rely on frame rate, making it 100% consistent even on console or vsync 60. Horse boosting also becomes comparatively more powerful if you can get Winged Boots to drop from enemies first. So with some luck and a right setup, it could become even faster than Benkei.

You should unlock Red Hare or Matsukaze for horse boosting since these horses have a higher base Speed (250), increasing the effectiveness of their boost.

This tactic also works in the original WO3, where it ranks among one of the best movement tactics available.

**Videos:**\

### Wang Yi zipping

This trick relies on a [neutral L-stick bug](#Neutral-L-stick-bugs). If you do Wang Yi's regular air attack high in air while keeping L-stick neutral, her air momentum starts building exponentially. Eventually she will zip forward at such a high velocity that she can potentially even end up outside the level boundaries.

The effect is different depending on your frame rate. At higher frame rates, the trick is more controllable and it only sends you flying forward at an extremely high speed. At low frame rate, your velocity increases past all comprehension and your coordinates may end up wrapping (?), causing Wang Yi to essentially teleport somewhere with a small degree of randomness.

This is without a doubt the single fastest movement tactic in the game - it's so fast that it literally breaks the game's physics. It's difficult to control, but being able to go nearly instantly from spot A to spot B can be very handy in speedruns. This is also the only known way to teleport past level boundaries, which is a rather unique utility. Unfortunately, the high difficulty and randomness of this trick makes it mostly relevant for individual level runs. You also need a lot of height to really make use of the exponential speed gain.

This trick DOES work in the original WO3, but it's much harder to set up since your ways of gaining a lot of height are far more limited.

**Videos:**\

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMgljUYorw4

### Xu Shu speed tech

This trick relies on a [neutral L-stick bug](#Neutral-L-stick-bugs). Xu Shu's first charge attack (C1) causes a dash towards any enemy on contact. This is quite a unique action that makes Xu Shu zip next to the enemy before he automatically segues into a double jump. If you perform Xu Shu's air charge attack and keep L-stick neutral frame precisely at the start of the double jump, the charge attack will use the extremely high velocity of the preceding dash instead of the usually capped double jump speed. This makes you fly forward for a few seconds uncontrollably fast - even faster than Benkei speed digging.

Unfortunately, this tactic is quite difficult to use for multiple reasons. You can only do this trick near enemies. Also, possibly because of level geometry-related reasons, sometimes a double jump doesn't happen as expected at the end of C1. Executing the trick and gaining high speed afterwards is extremely precise. And finally, once you get it to work, you can't steer during the speedy movement and you also lose your velocity if you bump into any other enemies or walls on the way, which limits the utility and consistency of the trick even further. Regardless, it can be situationally useful in individual level runs.

I'm not certain if this tactic requires a low frame rate to work.

This trick doesn't exist in the original WO3 since Xu Shu was only added as a playable character in WO3U.

I first saw this trick in gmptdgtm's runs on Twitter; the credits probably go to him.

### Zuo Ci speed tech

This trick relies on a [neutral L-stick bug](#Neutral-L-stick-bugs). If you do Zuo Ci's air special with L-stick neutral, you get far more speed than intended and move at a velocity that easily breaks the Speed cap as long as you stay in air.

Timing tests have shown that with Agility 10 your movement speed is equal to Benkei's speed digging (disregarding other factors such as terrain or cooldowns). However, this tactic is overall far more situational and hard to use. First of all, you need more than a single jump's worth of height to make the most out of your buggy velocity. You also lose your super speed if you touch the L-stick or Zuo Ci brushes any walls at any point. This means you can't really steer while doing this tech, and it's not practical to use in tight spaces either.

Getting super speed also requires a low frame rate. Although it's inconsistent on PS4, it can be done reliably on PC with vsync 30. You get a bit of extra speed to this attack by keeping L-stick neutral even on vsync 60, but it's not quite as much.

This movement tactic doesn't exist in regular WO3 because it doesn't have air specials.

### Pang Tong speed tech

Pang Tong has an air special that lets him propel through the air like a rocket. This attack is rather floaty, allowing you to move in air a fairly long distance at a speed which just barely breaks the Speed cap with Agility 10. It's also much more steerable than most other fast movement techniques.

As for drawbacks, you need some starting height to really make use of this movement tactic. It's also slightly inflexible in the sense that you can't interrupt it early - you're stuck flying in air until you slowly descend back to ground level.

This movement tactic doesn't exist in regular WO3 because it doesn't have air specials.

### Sanzang and Seimei Abe gliding

Sanzang and Seimei Abe have a nearly identical air charge attack that turns them into a glider for a time. This movement tactic is impacted by Agility as well as your character's current velocity. As such, it's better if you can start this movement tactic from a running jump, but having maxed out Speed is not necessary since you'll hit this movement's Speed cap at a far lower Speed already. One timing test suggested there's no significant speed difference between having 145 or 360 Speed during a single glide's worth of movement.

Even in optimal circumstances this movement tactic does not break the Speed cap - the average Speed is closer to something like 320. However, the main advantage of this tactic is the ability to glide an unparalleled distance through air. Even though you are slightly slower than Pang Tong, you can stay in air for much longer than him. This movement tactic is also highly steerable and more flexible since you can cancel it to fall down early once you've reached your destination.

Seimei Abe can get a bit more starting height to his glide by doing jump -> regular air attack -> charge air attack. He also falls down faster after you are done gliding. Both of these things make him the better choice in speedruns in my opinion. But Seimei Abe was only added in WO3U, which means Sanzang is the only character you can use for gliding in the original WO3.

### Neutral L-stick bugs

A number of air attacks in this game have buggy physics and they gain additional momentum if you keep L-stick neutral. Sometimes this effect is barely noticeable, but sometimes it makes your character's speed increase exponentially, resulting in incredibly fast movement. The most useful cases of neutral L-stick bugs are listed above, and the rest can be found in the [individual characters section](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/character-notes.md).

### Dynasty running cycle bug

All characters based on Dynasty Warriors-mechanics possess this small yet beneficial bug. When these characters begin their run cycle, their Speed is much higher than it should be during the first frame or two - not quite Speed cap levels, but close.

If you jump precisely at this time, you get to carry over this extra Speed in air. In practice, this allows a universal fast movement tactic with any Dynasty-character if you just do running jumps repeatedly at a precise timing. It's difficult to get perfectly consistent, but on average it should still speed up a character with a low base Speed and no double jump. It's pretty obscure, but might still be worth knowing.

This small oddity doesn't seem to happen at all with Samurai-style characters.

### Angled glitch

This is a glitch which impacts your character's z-axis so that they gain a slight forward angle. When angled, your character will sink into the ground when doing attacks. Sink deep enough and you are able to go under walls!

This trick is a useful alternative to infinite jumping for bypassing finite height obstacles. However, it has a few limitations as well. The biggest of them is that you need a ladder to give your character an angle, which means this glitch is not possible to do in every map. (Ladders are generally only present in maps adapted from Dynasty Warriors.)

There are two ways to start this glitch. First setup requires a character with Samurai Warriors-style mechanics. If you are on a ladder when a Samurai-style musou runs out, the ladder climbing animation will become interrupted and the angle of the ladder gets stuck on your character, which starts the glitch. Second setup involves activating TTA while on a ladder. The idea is the same: TTA interrupts ladder climb while leaving your character angled.

Both setups have their ups and downs. The first setup with a Samurai-style musou has an unskippable 5-second long animation when you activate the musou. The setup has a negative synergy with Thrift characters because having Thrift extends the waiting period before your character's musou expires. Also, being out of musou can be an inconvenience if you're planning on using the Samurai-style character afterwards for combat or infinite jumping.

The second setup with TTA requires you to fight some enemies to build a full TTA-bar. A character like Wang Yuanji with a Confluence on her weapon can build up a full TTA-bar with just a few attacks if you can find a thick crowd of enemies, so this isn't necessarily too big a problem. Another thing to watch out for is that after you activate TTA to start angled glitch, TTA will remain active in the background, resulting in a slow special attack cutscene soon unless you find a way to interrupt it first (using slippery surface or water). All these things considered, using Samurai-style musou is generally more convenient.

It's possible to categorize obstacles into three different tiers of "thickness", i.e. how easy they are to pass under. Thin garrison gates are really simple to bypass. Sturdier gates are medium-thick, requiring you to go a bit deeper underground before you can actually clip past them. Some obstacles like garrison walls are very thick, and your character needs to be able to sink at least a few meters before they can clip all the way through.

Angled glitch works especially well with attacks that have a non-looping, lengthy animation with a lot of forward movement. Some characters have a more convenient access to this kind of attacks, making them better candidates for angled glitching. There's a [tier list](#Character-tier-lists) down below which looks at this in more detail.

Your character will remain angled until you complete the current level, load an interim save, get on another ladder or ride your horse. Not being able to use a horse is an especially big drawback in some run categories since this will slow down your navigation a lot.

Angled glitch does not fully obsolete infinite jumping for general navigation purposes - for instance, you might want to jump up a steep cliff or over a large river in some level while angled. Being angled can make infinite jumping somewhat wonky, though, with certain characters like Yukimura Sanada becoming nearly unusable since their forward movement propels them heavily downwards.

As a side note, Agility has a negative synergy with angled glitch, making it slightly harder for your character to breach walls.

This glitch DOES work in the original Warriors Orochi 3, where it comes in frequent use due to the lack of infinite jumping options.

### Attacking through walls

Some characters have attacks that can hit enemies through the walls. Especially the new attacks added in WO3U (f.e. various air specials) are usually less glitch-proofed and have the unintended property of being able to hit enemies through collision.

Sniping an officer early from tens of meters away can be a viable, faster alternative to other speed tactics talked above. However, usually you have to have a maxed out character with a powerful weapon to be able to do respectable amounts of damage from such a long distance, making this idea more relevant for individual level runs.

Nezha (Human) is currently the best known character for attacking through walls. His fully charged C1 travels an insanely long distance - up to 30 meters? - and hits really hard as well.

Some characters like Xiahou Yuan, Guo Jia and Gyuki have an air special that shoots a downwards aerial projectile at a fairly steep angle. This projectile goes through walls and has an effectively near-infinite range, but you need a specific setup which gives you a lot of height to use it for officer sniping.

This glitch should work in the original WO3 too, but it's bound to be far less effective since the most useful attacks for hitting through walls were only added in WO3U.

### Garrison gate clip

There is a recurring garrison gate asset in WO3U that has a gap to its side, allowing you to clip through it from either side. The difficulty of doing this varies depending on the area, but it's usually not too hard. 

To go from outside to inside, you usually have to be on foot. Get a character with a high base Speed, then repeatedly attempt to run through the side of the gate. Press L1 repeatedly at a certain rhythm to stop and start running again and again. This should work quite well with Dynasty-characters at least. Most attacks that move your character at a high speed also work for doing this clip.

To go from inside to outside, you usually need a horse. Direct a horse to the corner of the gate, get a good angle and use a horse musou boost.

Some applications of the garrison clip do not work in the original WO3, for whatever reason. I've never seen the version where you go from outside to inside work, although inside to outside using horse musou boosting can work. Perhaps the collision of the gate is different?

### Sloped floor clip

Sloped floor means any walkable area that has a steep elevation, such as staircases. Sloped floor operates under different rules than other collision, and any character who can just get a high enough velocity can clip through it. Having Agility on your weapon makes sloped floor clipping more consistent, as Agility increases the effective velocity your character has during attacks.

Usually clipping through sloped floor isn't very helpful. If there's nothing underneath, your character will be returned back to ground level as soon as they are neutral, preventing you from staying out of bounds. However, in certain levels you can find sloped floor with a second floor underneath, such as the small stairways in Anegawa. At places like this, sloped floor clipping could potentially offer an alternative route through the level. But still... as a glitch tactic, it only has some fairly niche uses.

The game has a subtle mechanical limitation - the "stairs speed rule" - which caps a character's aerial Speed at under 150 and notably slows them down if they are in air over most staircases or angled collision. This is probably a counteracting measure by the developers to try to prevent sloped floor clipping with high-speed air attacks, and it does make it harder or impossible in some cases. However, it doesn't impact speed tactics which are strictly ground-based or which don't use the character's base Speed (like most air specials).

The best character for clipping through sloped floor is Taigong Wang thanks to a special attack offset bug which allows him to zip backwards controllably. Second best is Jia Xu thanks to his C1 that temporarily gives him such a high velocity that he can easily clip through most sloped floor. See which other characters are able to do this glitch from the [tier list](#Character-tier-lists) section.

It should be added that most tactics for going through sloped floor work better on vsync 30. Sloped floor collision seems much tighter and harder to breach on higher frame rates.

Since the original Warriors Orochi 3 did not have infinite jumping, sloped floor clip might be more useful in that game to f.e. do some unique shortcuts in levels like Anegawa or Honnoji.

### Sloped floor clip with a mount

Sloped floor clip becomes universally doable with any character with the help of a mount.

Simply leaving your mount standing on sloped floor and then pushing against it from below at high speed can give you additional leverage for clipping through. The "ceiling" provided by the collision of your mount lets you to clip sloped floor without needing such a high velocity as you normally would, this giving new characters access to sloped floor clips. This can be done with any of your mounts, but elephant and bear are easier than the horse in my opinion.

The bear is particularly unique. With some setups, all you need to do to clip through steep sloped floor is to run against the bear at a high speed. This means that essentially any character with a high enough running speed can now do sloped floor clip, making this rather esoteric trick much more accessible for a larger variety of different teams.

With bear or elephant, dismounting while the mount's back-left side is against some collision like a railing can also create a sloped floor breach. You can use the repelling force of the railing and the mount to "zip" you at a high enough speed upstairs that you clip through the floor. The positioning is easier to do with characters like Momiji and Hundun who leap a maximally long distance away from the mount when dismounting. Bear is much easier for this kind of a clip than elephant since elephant is a much taller mount.

### Special attack offset bug

This is an obscure mechanics bug which impacts certain special moves. If you interrupt an attack with a special that has an offset bug, your character's location will be immediately reset to the point where it was at the start of the attack. In practice, this will make the character zip forward or backwards the same distance they had moved since start of the attack. So, what's the use of this? The most obvious use (and it's not particularly obvious) is that zipping gives your character an extremely high velocity for a moment, which may allow them to clip sloped floor.

To try this out for yourself, pick Taigong Wang. Start doing his sprint attack but interrupt it with his ground special before the attack animation is over. He should now zip backwards up to 2 meters as the special move begins, and if you do this on a staircases, he will clip through it. You can use the ground special to interrupt almost any regular move in Taigong Wang's movelist to do a zip, but his sprint attack is likely his best attack for this purpose since it has so much forward movement.

Some characters like Motonari Mori and Kotaru Fuma have a buggy air special instead. There aren't as many opportunities to interrupt attacks with an air special than there are with a ground special because grounded attacks by default always cancel into ground specials. However, especially the Samurai-characters have many attacks which cancel into air specials instead, even when it seems like it shouldn't make sense. For example: you can interrupt Motonari Mori's sprint attack with his air special to do an even bigger zip than with Taigong Wang.

Sadly, air specials are a bit harder to use for sloped floor clipping because they usually position your character upwards, making it harder to stay below ground level after clipping. This also means you can't use these characters for clipping sloped floor in the original WO3, because it didn't have air specials.

Not all instances of offset bug are helpful. For instance, your horse's musou also has an offset bug. This is pretty easy to observe by doing a Dynasty-style horse boost during the first second or two after you start running with your horse. Your horse will noticeably zip backwards as the musou begins, which is usually a hindrance since it slows down navigation. On the plus side, you can clip through staircases and even take your horse out of bounds by using this trick.

In rare situations, it seems it's possible to clip through a wall using a large zip. For instance, this can happen if you use Taigong Wang or Motonari Mori to zip while inside a very tight space between an opened gate and a wall. Perhaps this tactic would work as a general gate clip in some rare situations, but so far it doesn't seem to work very consistently, and it doesn't seem like you can use a horse to create an artificial cramped space for clipping through gates either. At any rate, this potential application needs a bit more research.

### Soul splitting

This is a very unique mechanics glitch I haven't seen in any other musou and which might have some unique niche uses in speedruns.

Character data consists of two parts in WO3U. First part is your character's model. The hurtbox of every attack is a part of the character model, and it's also the character model which reacts to gravity, triggers, water and slippery collision. Second part is your character's collision. This is an invisible bubble which the camera tries to follow at all times. Any attack data related to character positioning is tied to this data element.

This glitch separates these two data elements, causing odd side effects during most of your character's animations. As a quick example, your character's model will not move at all while doing attacks. Since hurtbox is tied to the character model, in practice this will make almost every attack seem like it has much less reach than before. Meanwhile, the invisible collision bubble and camera keep moving forward according to the current attack's projected movement, only to reset back to the location of the character model at the end of the animation, whichi looks disorienting.

To start this glitch, you need a full TTA-bar, a horse and either water or slippery collision that is *available at ground level* so that your horse can access it without having to jump. Especially the second requirement makes the setup for this glitch quite specialized, and as such, it can't be done in all the maps.

Instructions: get a full TTA-bar. Get on your horse. Ride into deep water or slippery floor and activate TTA at precisely the right time so that it becomes immediately cancelled. This should start the glitch. The glitch remains active until you leave the current stage or do another TTA.

More about the specific theoretical uses and other details of this glitch:

- If you do an attack towards a wall, your character model becomes pushed backwards according to the current attack's projection. Since the model itself has no collision, it will temporarily go through walls. If you have a character with a lengthy "dash" attack like Yukimura Sanada, you can propel the character model backwards up to several meters through walls, potentially hitting enemies and level triggers that are close enough. In other words, this is an alternative and unique way to hit enemies through walls with certain characters, and being able to hit triggers through walls early might allow a skip in some level too. However, so far it hasn't been possible to stay on the wrong side of a wall once the current attack ends. Your character model is always moved back "in bounds" to the side you started from, preventing this tactic from being an universal wall clip.

- Although most attacks work so that your character's collision returns back to the character model at the end of the attack, this effect can be reversed with most ground-based attacks if you interrupt the attack in the middle by f.e. jumping or doing an air special. With lengthy "dash" attacks, this allows you to instantly teleport your character model up to several meters, potentially allowing you to bypass level triggers. Yukimura Sanada's air special also works for this purpose, which is convenient since it's the single longest dash in the game.

- Since the invisible collision bubble does not respond to gravity, you can do an unique long jump tactic with Speed-type characters by projecting their collision several meters over a pit with some lengthy attack, then double jumping out of it.

- Since the invisible collision bubble only reacts to flat walls and not sloped floor, you can use a lengthy attack to project your character's collision fully inside ground if the nearby sloped floor allows this. If you now teleport your character model under the floor, the game will send your whole character upwards back to ground level. This could theoretically allow instantaneous climbing up hills, and you could also use this tactic to go underneath walls the same way as with angled glitch.

- There are some attacks which work normally despite the glitch. Most air attacks and some ground-based attacks like Kotaru Fuma's musou move you forward like normal.

- Every character can generate an immense amount of speed by jumping frame-precisely after doing an attack. This is because the moment where your character's collision returns back to the character model has an extremely high velocity, and this velocity will carry over to a properly timed jump. The larger the distance between your character's collision and model, the larger the potential speed. Although this looks cool, it may be a bit too difficult to use as a speed movement tactic... right?

This glitch didn't exist in the original Warriors Orochi 3 since you couldn't use TTA on horseback in it.

### Delayed input bugs

This is an obscure trick with some very niche uses that works at least in Dynasty Warriors 7 and this title.

All the characters/weapons in these games have their own canned combo strings that consist of regular attacks and charge attacks. However, if you avoid tapping buttons and instead give precise input at the last possible moment, your attack animations will usually look much more janky than usual. So what's up with that?

With only a few exceptions, all the combo animations run at a set timer. No matter how fast or slow you press buttons, the next attack in the combo always starts at a specific frame in relation to the first attack in the combo. If you avoid tapping buttons and instead only give one precise input as late as possible as you continue the combo, the game does not get an early signal to seamlessly switch between attack animations, and the new animation will instead start instantly with some frames dropped from the start so that it would still fit the general timing scheme of the current combo.

These dropped frames cause the janky looking visual effect, and occasionally they may cause other effects too. In Dynasty Warriors 7, doing combos with delayed input could cause projectile weapons to not fire projectiles, or other miscellaneous effects. Missing projectiles are less common in WO3U, but this can still happen if you do certain horseback combos with delayed input.

Small zips are also a possible result. Your character's relative position is adjusted at the start of each attack to where they're supposed to be at that point in the combo string. If there is an attack which features a lot of movement and lenient buffers make it drop many frames, your character will be moved from spot A to spot B with no interpolation - as if zipping. Very large zips let your character clip through sloped floor, although in practice doing this is extremely uncommon.

Another obscure use case is doing extra damage within certain combo strings. Due to how input buffering works in this game, it's usually possible to buffer something like two regular attacks (S1 -> S2) and still lead into second charge attack (C2) in the same combo. With some characters like Wang Yuanji and Zhenji, with precise timing the buffered S2 actually hits enemies before C2 starts, allowing you to do an S1 -> S2 -> C2 combo and increase your DPS slightly compared to just doing S1 -> C2. To do this, press 'regular attack' twice at a quick succession, then 'charge attack' at last possible moment after S2 has already started.

As one strange detail, if you instead do the above example by first pressing 'regular attack', then 'regular attack' -> 'charge attack' at a quick succession during the last possible moment, your character will start S2 which is interrupted by C2 which does NOT drop frames. So, in practice, the attack comes out with a maybe 10 frame delay compared to normal. Normally it's not possible to create this kind of delay within combo strings, but could such a subtle detail matter even in high-level gameplay...?

### Escort mission time saves

You can speed up some escort missions by pushing the escorted NPC around instead of waiting for them to run to their destination. You can do this on foot, but it's generally recommended to use a horse for this purpose since they have a slightly wider collision. Red Hare is bigger and faster than a regular horse, and probably your best option for NPC pushing, although it can be difficult to do an extended push since NPCs tend to slip past your horse quite easily.

This trick only works when the NPC is in "navigation" mode, i.e. they're intentionally trying to head for a specific destination. Stationary NPCs resist attempts to move them, and they soon run back to their original location if you move them more than a few meters.

There are some areas in the game where NPCs have a hard time moving around. They may constantly get stuck on doorways or collision, wasting a lot of time. In a situation like this, it might not be worth it to try pushing the NPC. Better option might be to move away from them and look away - being off-camera makes an NPC move towards their destination without getting stuck as much.

Replacing an escort character with their generic officer variant, f.e. turning Ma Chao into Ma Teng in Breakthrough in Yiling, seems to be a bad idea. It seems generic officers all have an abysmal running speed, probably somewhere in the 100-110 range. At any rate, they always seem to run slower than even the slowest of your playable characters.

### Upgrade stone and promotion duping

The game has a menu glitch which allows you to duplicate upgrade stones or hand out infinite promotions to everyone as soon as you just have a single character who can be promoted.

To dupe promotions, enter the promotion menu, place the cursor on your lv. 100 character, then quickly press up or down at the same time as you press 'X' (or equivalent) to affirm. Done correctly, the "are you sure?" sub-menu opens up, but the graphics in the background change to display the wrong character. If you now choose 'yes', the wrong character will get promoted. The original character stays at lv. 100, allowing this to be repeated indefinitely.

As a side note, if you promote a character through this glitch, you will not unlock their extra item slots. If you want to have them, it's advisable to promote the character only once, then give them a second promotion with growth points or normal level-ups. Once you reach lv. 100, you unlock all four additional item slots for them at once.

To do this glitch with upgrade stones, put the cursor on a character who has a lot of upgrade stones, then press 'X' (or equivalent) at the same time as you press up or down. This will dupe all the upgrade stones to the other promoted character, although you won't see the number get updated until you try using the upgrade stones or back out of the menu.

Upgrade stone duping lets you upgrade any character's stats to maximum, which is essential for preparing your save for NG+ runs. You can even boost a character's Speed up to 500, even though the menu normally only allows increasing Speed to 180/200. To do this, dupe upgrade stones from a character who has less than 180/200 Speed without cancelling out of the menu. The game is only checking if the character you started the glitch with is able to increase their Speed, which leaves the currently selected character free to upgrade their Speed past their current limit. However, so far upgrading Speed past 360 seems redundant, as there are no known instances where having a speed of 500 makes a difference compared to having a Speed of 360 (universal Speed cap).

# Other mechanics details

## Weapons

### Big-star weapons

Every character in the game has a selection of big-star weapons. They start with a very low attack power but gain a large boost after you build their compatibility, enough to usually (but not always) end up being more powerful than fully powered lv. 4 weapons.

Big-star weapons also have hidden character-specific effects. Credits to [wowitsyugi's weapon FAQ](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/778279-warriors-orochi-3-ultimate/faqs/64178) which contains some original information regarding this. It's unknown if every character has a hidden big-star weapon effect. If they do, most are unknown to this date.

### Mystic weapons

Mystic weapons are a special category of weapons which were added in Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate and can only be unlocked in specific levels with specific characters. Their power level is above lv. 4 weapons but under lv. 5 weapons, which means they unfortunately end up becoming obsolete in late game.

## Weapon attributes

### Agility

The game has three weapon attributes - Agility, Potency and Precision - which give a percentage based buff or a debuff to your character's attack speed. Agility can be boosted up to lv. 10, but Potency and Precision are golden attributes that only have one level.

I did some testing to figure out just how much these attributes actually change attack speed by observing the frames of Orochi X's ground special at different levels of Agility. It turns out the logic behind Agility is a bit stranger than expected. Here's a table to illustrate it:

| Agility | Lv. 1 | Lv. 2 | Lv. 3 | Lv. 4 | Lv. 5 | Lv. 6 | Lv. 7 | Lv. 8 | Lv. 9 | Lv. 10 |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Level bonus | 1.3% | 2.7% | 1.3% | 2.7% | 1.3% | 1.3% | 2.7% | 0% | 2.7% | 1% |
| Current total | 1.3% | 4% | 5.3% | 8% | 9.3% | 10.6% | 13.3% | 13.3% | 16% | 17% |

At first it seems that there's a steady pattern of 1.3% and 2.7% increase with every odd and even level, respectively. However, the pattern resets at lv. 6, and lv. 8 doesn't give any speed boost at all. What a ripoff!

Building up Agility for certain characters might be a worthwhile endeavor in some longer category, so it might be useful to know that even numbers are the best milestones to aim for until you reach Agility 5.

To do: test if having Agility 1 even saves any frames with normal length attack animations.

### Potency / Precision

Potency and Precision on the other hand slow down your character's attack speed. Either Potency or Precision alone in your weapon seems to give the attack speed penalty of -14.7%. If you have both, the penalty increases to -27.5%.

To do: I hope these numbers aren't too wonky, might be useful to re-time at some point.

## Equipment

### Dragon's Eye

This item enables Power- and Technique-characters to interrupt charge attacks with a jump after a certain breakpoint. Speed-type characters have something resembling this skill naturally. Wonder-characters get no benefit from this item.

If both Dragon's Eye and Heavenly Sash are equipped on a Technique-character, Heavenly Sash takes priority.

### Heavenly Sash

This item enables Technique-type characters to cancel charge attacks with a sidestep after a certain breakpoint. It does absolutely nothing for other type of characters?

The sidesteps created with Heavenly Sash seem to have some different properties compared to regular sidesteps. Their directionality can change on the fly, causing your character to slowly turn around during the sidestep. Certain characters like Ling Tong also "zip" a little bit during a forward sidestep, giving the movement more reach than normal.

# Tips for preparing your save file

Getting your characters in a perfect shape requires a lot of grinding, there's just no way around that. However, there are several things you can do to speed up the process.

## Gauntlet-Mode is the key

Gauntlet-mode is an infinitely replayable mode where it's very easy to get experience. There are also many unique resources you can't get on any other mode, such as some equippable items as well as 5-star weapon ingredients.

Every time you replay Gauntlet-mode, you unlock new type of levels (as indicated by their color in the level select-screen). The only difference between level types is that later levels start with a higher miasma; this can speed up grinding since certain good items can only drop at higher miasma levels.

## Starting out

It all starts from having decent characters who can survive for extended periods of time on Gauntlet-mode.

Your characters are quite weak when you are first starting out. Try to stay inside levels a fairly short amount of time since difficulty escalates quickly as the Miasma level grows. Use a formation that has "Dem. Eye" (or later "Getaway") to find the exit portal quickly when needed.

Search for purple portals to get experience fast. Gaining experience awards a lot of growth points afterwards, which is also a big help for leveling up your characters. Focus on getting a single character to lv. 100 first. Lv. 100 is a game changer, because this is when you can promote them and start using upgrade stones.

Zhou Yun is the best for grinding experience with out of the regular Gauntlet-mode starter characters. Althogh he runs slower than Hanzo Hattori, he can be a real beast at taking down large groups of enemies. Try spamming the air special (jump cancelling in between uses) to destroy hundreds of troops in seconds.

As an additional tip for survival, try to form a team with a lot of Thrift-type characters, since having them around makes it easier to spam specials or Musou. Stay on the lookout for Thrifty people! For the record, all the characters who have Thrift as their main skills are Dong Zhuo, Liu Shan, Motochika Chosokabe, No, Xu Shu and Zhang Jiao. Additionally, Ayane, Hundun, Liu Bei, Mitsuhide Akechi, Nene, Wei Yan and Yinglong unlock Thrift after you've promoted them once.

## After getting your first lv. 100 character

Once you have at least one character at lv. 100, you can [dupe upgrade stones and promotions](#Upgrade-stone-and-promotion-duping) to gain a dramatic increase in power very quick. It's especially recommended to give your characters a high life to survive for longer and 360 Speed to make navigation faster. Upgrading Attack also helps, but overall, I think you get much more benefit from having good weapons and weapon properties than good stats. And while we're on the topic of weapons...

## Acquiring 5-star weapons

The Gauntlet-mode shop is trash; you'll never unlock decent weapons there. It's recommended to play Story-mode up to later chapters (like Chapter 4) and use the Story-mode shop instead to purchase yourself 4-star weapons. Getting Mystic Weapons at this point is also an option, but they will become obsolete fairly quickly and might be more trouble than they're worth.

Unlocking 5-star weapons is a painful grind. To get the right ingredients, you have to defeat famous officers at a high miasma level so that they may randomly drop their personal item. You need at least two for any 5-star weapon. You can see the names of the officers who will appear in any given level from the level select-menu if you want to go hunting for these items.

It might be worth it maxing out a big-star weapon for some Thrift-character to get a big early boost to your attack power. Hanging out in high miasma fights tends to drop some weapons that have a boosted innate power; with any luck, you can replace big-star and 4-star weapons pretty soon with a dropped weapon and that way increase your effectiveness while waiting for those 5-star weapons to arrive. Ultimately, there is no alternative to 5-star weapons that you've hand-crafted and set-up yourself.

Try to unlock Mystic Bells so that dropped items are vacuumed towards your character so that you don't miss anything in the heat of fighting.

## Useful weapon traits?

In short, anything that boosts damage: Brawn, Might, Frenzy, Blast, Aerial, etc. depending on what type of damage you're planning on doing with the character.

Agility increases all weapon attack speeds up to 17%. It's a must for speedrunning; not only does it increase your damage-per-second, but it also increases the speed of any movement technique that is based around attack movement, f.e. Benkei's or Pang Tong's air specials. Agility *can* make combat with certain characters more tricky, but this is not a particularly noticeable drawback in speedrunning.

Osmosis is a life-saver if you decide to break Gauntlet-mode with a Samurai-style Thrift character like No. Start your musou to become invulnerable and keep supplying yourself with infinite energy by doing a charge attack every now and then, simple as that.

Alacrity gives you a health & musou refill with every 500-hit combo, which again wil completely break Gauntlet-mode if you have a Samurai-style character who can generate a lot of combo, f.e. Motonari Mori.

Bombast is similar, giving you some free musou-energy every 500 hits of a combo. If you are playing as a character who has good specials and can generate combo easily, this can make them nearly invulnerable.

Aggression gives the helpful War God's Axe (i.e. attack buff) effect every 200 hits. You won't reach 200 hits in most levels while doing individual level runs, but it's definitely useful when grinding.

Procurement in your weapon duplicates all item drops all of the time, which essentially cuts the grind short by half. Incredibly useful to have.

## Building up compatibility

After you have a 5-star weapon, it's only at a third or so of its full power. To get a hefty +99 damage bonus to it, you have to use it in combat. A lot.

The process of building up compatibility is easier with characters who have massive, deadly area of effect attacks, like Xiahou Dun with his air special. Some characters don't have this luxury, making their grind feel that much grindier.

To speed up the accumulation of weapon exp, get Harmony on your weapon. Besides that, there are a few characters who have Expertise as a passive skill - keeping them in your party will also speed up the rate at which you gain weapon exp. These characters are Gyuki, Momiji, Rachel and Da Ji.

But still, even in the best case scenario, building up weapon exp is very, very slow indeed... Plan ahead on who you're going to use in individual level runs and upgrade selectively to save some time.

## Building up skills

Developing your characters' passive skills such as Thrift is similar but much faster than building up weapon experience. You should generally have S-rank skills by the time you've finished building up your 5-star weapon too. If you got problems with building up skills, you could always try putting Industry on your weapon or getting characters with Aptitude (i.e. Dodomeki or Gyuki) on your team.

## Anything else?

You can also get some unique gear from Gauntlet-mode. You might not strictly need these items for NG+ speedruns, but they can't hurt. Belt of Concentration (continuous Musou regen) helps with some tactics, for instance.

Some individual levels also can make use of Matsukaze or Red Hare, so those are helpful to unlock as well.

# Selecting your team

General guidelines for team building (especially on NG+ categories):

- Always try to take Benkei or Xiahou Yuan for fast navigation.

- If you want to infinite jump, always get Xingcai. If you need a lot of horizontal reach, pair her with Yukimura Sanada. Or if you need fast height gain, Hanzo Hattori.

- If you want to wallzip, always get Zhang He. If you want to keep flying through the air afterwards, consider Pang Tong, Sanzang, Seimei Abe or two infinite jumpers.

- If you want to use angled glitch with Samurai-setup, have some low-level Samurai-character specifically prepared for this purpose. I like Muneshige Tachibana since he has a low base musou and he can use his sprint attack to bypass thick walls without needing to use any musou.

- If you want to use angled glitch with TTA-setup, Wang Yuanji with a Confluence on her weapon can build a full TTA-bar almost instantly against a large enemy crowd.

- If you need to prepare for late spawning officers, Dong Zhuo is probably one of the best characters. He has a high base damage and he can set up a completely controllable bomb-based ambush to take out multiple targets at once.

Also check out the [character tier lists](#Character-tier-lists) and [individual characters section](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/character-notes.md) for more detail on specific characters.

## Helpful skills

- Efficacy

Efficacy increases damage inflicted upon enemy officers. This skill doesn't influence character stats; rather, it just seems to increase your raw damage output against officers. This means it works even if your characters already have max stats, and is therefore useful even in categories where you use maxed out characters.

- Vigor

Vigor increases damage inflicted with combo attacks. This is another skill which should influence your raw damage output. Intuitively, I've always thought Efficacy might be more useful in runs since you don't really combo enemies all that much, but I can't say for sure.

- Regeneration

Increases passive Musou regeneration. Might help in situations where you use a lot of Musou, like infinite jumping, but with max stats it's generally not that pertinent.

- Thrift

Thrift reduces all Musou costs, and it has some specific uses in speedruns. If you have a team with three Thrift-characters, doing Musou on horse is so cheap that you can keep spamming it over and over, which is a good fast movement tactic. Thrift is also the main way to break Gauntlet-mode in half.

## Skills that are not useful for NG+ runs:

- Fellowship

Increases damage inflicted with Switch Combos. This skill also influences your raw damage output, but so far I haven't really found an use for Switch Combos in a speedrun.

- Focus, Fortitude, Impulse, Potence, Power, Speed, Technique, Wonder

If your character has max stats already, then these skills do nothing. Otherwise, they can be helpful.

- Bounty, Acclaim

Getting more gems or exp is a part of the grind before the speedrun; no longer pertinent once you have max stats.

- Dexterity, Solidarity

These two are defensive skills. You're not supposed to get hit all that much in a speedrun!

- Impact, Stamina

These two skills grant health or musou back after every 100 KO. They are pretty useful in casual play, but not necessary at all in speedruns.

- Trinity

Building up TTA gauge might have a situational use for activating certain glitches in speedruns, but for that purpose you'd rather just have Confluence on your character's weapon. Also, there's no TTA in Gauntlet-mode, so this trait is extra useless there.

# Character tier lists

## Top 5 characters for chainable horizontal air movement:

Yukimura Sanada, Xingcai, Hundun, Jia Xu, Yueying

Note: Zhou Yu's air special is also fast, chainable horizontal air movement, but it destroys your height.

Note: Huang Zhong gets a honorable mention. However, his air special turns him backwards and is pretty awkward to use for movement.

## Top 5 characters for non-chainable horizontal air movement:

Seimei Abe, Sanzang, Pang Tong, Wei Yan, Xu Huang.

Note: Wang Yi's zipping is basically fastest non-chainable aerial movement, but it's quite situational.

Note: Benkei, Zuo Ci and Yoshitsune Minamoto get an honorable mention for their buggy air special speed.

## Top 5 characters for chainable vertical air movement:

Hanzo Hattori, Xingcai, Yuan Shao, Wang Yuanji, Ayane

Note: Kai gets a honorable mention for being pretty similar to Ayane.

Note: Guan Ping is trickier to use since he doesn't have double jump, but his air special gives him a ludicrous amount of height fast.

# Terminology

- WO3 and WO3U = Warriors Orochi 3 and Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate, respectively. These two main different versions of the game have some significant mechanical differences which makes it worthwhile to sometimes distinguish between the two.

- S1, S2, C1, C2, etc. = these abbreviations refer to a character's regular attacks and charge attacks.

- double musou. A coordinated musou attack where multiple nearby characters do it simultaneously.

- slippery collision/floor. A kind of a level element. If a character lands on floor like this, they lose control and slide downward until they reach normal floor again. If reaching normal ground directly is not possible, they will instead teleport to last known ground coordinates after a few seconds have passed.

- stairs speed rule. Your character's Speed is capped at around 150 if they are in air over stairs or slippery collision. Probably a countermeasure by the developers to prevent clipping through sloped surfaces with high-speed aerial movement. However, this does not affect strictly ground-based movement or any other movement which is not based on your character's current Speed (like most air specials).

- true musou. Characters will do true musou if they are low on health or have Verity on their weapon. With Dynasty-characters, this means their musou has more attack power. Samurai-characters get a new finisher to their musou instead.

- TTA = True Triple Attack. You need a full TTA-gauge to do this move. It's a slow and flashy attack which makes enemies slow down and become very floaty at the slightest touch. Generates crystals.

- zip. Any kind of extremely high-velocity movement. Not to be confused with [wallzipping](#Wallzipping), which is a glitch technique for gaining height fast.
