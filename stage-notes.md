This file contains information on the various stages as they appear in the game. Still a work-in-progress...

Most stage unlocks aren't listed for the main campaign for now because they can be quite conditional and I'd have to verify some things by replaying the game.

# Unlock conversations

Some stages can only be unlocked by talking to your characters at the camp. For these conversations to appear, you have to have unlocked all the characters who appear in the conversation. Some conversations probably have a hidden requirement and cannot appear until reaching a specific Chapter. Alas, it's necessary to try to figure this stuff out for a potential 100% speedrun route.

Here's an incomplete list of conversations from my previous playthrough. I only started writing these down from Chapter 3 onward.

Note: you can skip having to run to conversations by switching to the appropriate character. This makes the dialogue appear right near the blacksmith.

Motonari Mori + Da Ji + Achilles to unlock Ambush at Kyushu.

Huang Zhong + Ma Dai + Xu Shu to unlock Breakthrough at Yiling and Xu Shu.
