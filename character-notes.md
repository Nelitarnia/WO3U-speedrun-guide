# Individual character notes

Characters can be ranked according to following criteria:

- Speed movement. How fast a character can move solo. By default, testing takes into account Agility 10 on weapon but assumes default Speed. This is for two reasons: firstly, assuming everyone is at base Speed is more useful for covering original WO3 tactics where upgrade stone duping did not exist. Secondly, Agility 10 is easier to set up in full game runs than 360 Speed, so realistically you'd encounter a situation where a character has Agility on weapon but only base Speed more often than the other way around.
- - 0 = character's maximum speed does not exceed 150. 1 = character's maximum speed is under 200, does not obsolete a horse. 2 = character's maximum speed is over 200, can obsolete a horse. 3 = character can move at Speed cap or go over it. Half a point may be added or removed because of conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can pass Speed cap in steep downhill areas but nowhere else.
 
- Angled glitch. How good a character is for going under walls while angled. Characters who have a convenient access to lengthy non-looping attacks that propel them forward work the best for this purpose.
- - 0 = character cannot pass any kind of walls while angled. 1 = character can pass thin walls while angled. 2 = character can pass medium-thick walls while angled. 3 = character can pass thick walls while angled. Half a point may be added or removed for conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can breach thick walls but the attack for doing so is inconvenient, like the last hit of a slow combo string.
 
- Attacking through walls. How well a character can snipe targets through walls.
- - 0 = character can't hit anything through walls. 1 = character can hit a short distance (2-5 meters) through walls. 2 = character can hit a medium distance (around 5 - 10 meters) through walls. 3 = character can hit a long or even arbitrarily long distance through walls. Note that these meter amounts are just rough estimates. Half a point may be added or removed for conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can hit a long distance through walls, but you need a specific setup to do so.
 
- Solo high jump. What's the highest jump a character can do solo. My testing has been done in Luoyang, where there's a tiered staircase with a ledge above it.
- - 0 = character can't pass the lowest tier in Luoyang. 1 = character can pass the first tier in Luoyang. 2 = character can pass the second tier in Luoyang. 3 = character can skip the staircase and jump up the above ledge from the ground level. Half a point may be added if a character's highest jump is around the middle of two tiers.
 
- Solo long jump. What's the longest jump a character can do solo.
- - 0 = character can jump less than a double jump's worth. 1 = character can jump a double jump's worth. 2 = character can jump triple or quadruple jump's worth. 3 = character can glide or fly for even longer than that.
 
- Team jumping (horizontal). How well a team member can contribute in an infinite jump which needs to have a good horizontal reach.
- - 0 = character is incompatible with infinite jumping. 1 = character can sustain an infinite jump with no real contribution. 2 = character is helpful in an infinite jump. 3 = character is a superb infinite jumper.

- Team jumping (vertical). How well a team member can contribute in an infinite jump that just needs to get height as quick as possible.
- - 0 = character is incompatible with infinite jumping. 1 = character can sustain an infinite jump with no real contribution. 2 = character is helpful in an infinite jump. 3 = character is a superb infinite jumper.
 
- Wallzipping. How good is a character in wallzipping? Zhang He and Xiahou Ba belong in a tier of their own because of their superb speed buff that makes wallzipping more consistent for them than anyone else.
- 0 = characters who have no wallzip-compatible attacks. 1 = characters who can do a wallzip. 2 = characters who can buff their own speed for more consistent wallzips. 3 = Zhang He and Xiahou Ba.

- Trap setup. Does a character have any tools to save time in combat encounters where you have to wait for enemies to spawn. For instance, Dong Zhuo can leave multiple bombs which can kill multiple officers in different parts of the same room right as they spawn, saving a lot of time compared to another character who would have to take care of them with normal attacks.
- 0 = no way to setup delayed damage or prepare in any other way. 1 = inconsistent or weak delayed damage or setup. 2 = good delayed damage or setup. 3 = incredible delayed damage or setup.

- Sloped floor clip. Can a character clip through sloped floor?
- 0 = no way to clip through sloped floor. 1 = very situational sloped floor clip. 2 = better sloped floor clip ability. 3 = best sloped floor clip ability.
