# Individual character notes

This section takes an in-depth look at each character in the game from the perspective of speedrun utility. Still a work-in-progress...

## Benkei

• Technique / Technique + Dexterity

### Top speed movement

Benkei's air special makes him leap high into the air followed by a quick forward downsmash that leaves him underground in a "digging" state. This action uses Benkei's base Speed and it also gains a percentage-based speed bonus from Agility 10. Conveniently for speedrunners, it ignores Speed cap and allows movement at such a high velocity it can even be difficult to control. The average Speed of this technique is hard to estimate, but it's probably in the 420-440 range.

Benkei speed digging is explained in more detail [here](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md#Benkei-speed-tech).

This is the most commonly used movement tactic in individual level runs since it's so fast and versatile. It even works in areas with tricky terrain since Benkei can bypass water surface, angled surfaces and ledges while digging. However, it's harder to utilize in full game runs since it requires you to setup Benkei with a maxed out Speed and Agility 10 first, plus it's quite costly as far as musou is concerned.

### Top high jump

The leap at the start of Benkei's air special gives him a surprising amount of height in a very short span of time, so this attack works as a high jump or a high jump finisher all by itself. Benkei can cross tier 2 in Luoyang staircase solo, which is a feat only a few characters in the game are capable of.

Unfortunately, Benkei can't contribute to infinite jumps in any other capacity since his air special ends in a downsmash.

### Good angled glitch

Benkei can go past even thick walls with his C3 while angled. Additionally, his sprint attack and C7 allow him go past up to medium-thick walls. Since he has a Samurai-style musou, he can also be used to setup angled glitch, although realistically, you'd probably rather use his energy for speed movement.

### Skill breakpoints

Each use of his air special costs 45 musou. At lv. 1, you can do it 3 times without having to refill your musou. Lv. 7 gives you 4 uses, lv. 20+ gives you 5 uses.

### Other notes

Benkei's C2 also makes him dig. It works the same way as the air special, except it has such a slow speed that it generally isn't useful in speedruns. However, the fact that you can do it while grounded without having to move much can occasionally give it a niche use: one time I got stuck in a pit out of bounds, surrounded by angled surfaces which prevented me from infinite jumping or using Benkei's air special to get out, but doing C2 let me controllably climb out of the pit instead.

Benkei cannot fall while digging. If you dig over a ledge, Benkei will simply teleport to ground level instantly.

His air special can hit enemies through walls, but at such a short range it's unlikely to be useful.

## Cai Wenji

• Wonder / Wonder + Impact

### Average angled glitch

She can bypass thin obstacles while angled by using her sprint attack.

### Average infinite jump

Her air special is rather slow, but it lets her hover in place as a part of an infinite jump chain.

### Average combat setup

Her EX causes damaging projectiles to fall from the sky for around 5 seconds while she is free to move and do attacks. It might help to prepare for a fight somewhere, although I would assume the damage from the falling projectiles is largely inconsistent.

### Neutral L-stick bug

Her regular air attack has a [neutral L-stick bug](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md#Neutral-L-stick-bugs) and it can gain extreme forward velocity (rivalling Zuo Ci) if you do it from a running jump and leave L-stick neutral. It's somewhat hard to utilize effectively, though, since you need a lot of starting height to really benefit from the glitchy speed. The attack falls down fairly fast and Cai Wenji doesn't have double jump either, making it a bit more arduous to setup. Also, you only gain super speed on vsync 30.

### Other notes

Her air charge attack features a flashy looking somersault through the air. Unfortunately, most of its apparent height gain is fake, so it can't be used in Save & Quit infinite jumps very effectively.

Cai Wenji gains an aura around her after doing her EX. I'm not sure if this is an actual buff, or if it's just an indication that 

## Hanzo Hattori

• Speed / Efficacy + Vigor

### Top infinite jump

Hanzo Hattori is arguably the best character in the game for chainable vertical air movement, and maybe in the Top 10 for chainable horizontal air movement too. His air special zips him forward and upward a couple of meters. The animation is short too, allowing it to be repeated quickly in a jump. Having access to double jump is very useful as well.

### Top high jump

Hanzo Hattori's naturally high ground jump, air special and ability to double jump allow him to gain respectable height even while solo. He can cross tier 2 in Luoyang with double jump -> air special -> double jump.

### Good angled glitch

He can go past up to medium-thick walls with his sprint attack. He can also be used to setup angled glitch.

As a side note, the forward zip of his air special is not impacted by angle, which allows him to be a solid infinite jumper even while angled.

### Average sloped floor clip

Hanzo Hattori is able to breach some sloped floor with his air special which allows him to do a controllable forward zip. However, it's difficult to stay out of bounds afterwards because the air special also gives him a lot of height and usually pushes him back up above ground level. He needs very steep angled floor (or to save & reload mid-attack) for this to work.

Alternatively, his true musou makes him zip around at a high enough velocity that he can clip sloped floor. To have the right angle, turn Hanzo Hattori so that he is facing away from the direction you want to clip. Clipping through something like the staircases in Nanzhong is easy, but I couldn't get this to work on smaller staircases in Anegawa. This tactic might be a bit too uncontrollable for precision clips, or perhaps it just needs a better setup.

### Unique clone power

Hanzo Hattori can create two clones of himself using C5 or true musou. These clones are controlled with the same input as the playable character, although their movement does have a few additional limitations. The clones cannot block, double jump, use special moves, turn while attacking or create additional clones with C5. They also disappear after you wait around 10-15 seconds, or even sooner if you switch characters, try to get on horse or the true musou finishing move is about to start.

The clones have the same Speed as Hanzo Hattori. Attack speed as influenced by Agility, Precision and Potency is copied to the clones too, but many other weapon properties (like Multi, Typhoon, etc.) don't seem to work on the clones. If Hanzo Hattori is angled or "soul split", the created clones will be likewise glitched.

Besides increasing Hanzo Hattori's immediate combat power, the clones have two other potentially quite powerful utility in speedruns. First is that the clones can be separated to cover a larger range with their attacks. It should even be possible to defeat officers from a great distance away with a separated clone, which could save navigation time.

Second is that with a precise positioning, it's possible to spawn clones through thin walls like garrison gates. Using C5 for this requires precise positioning, but it seems quite easy if you activate true musou instead. This is likely quite a powerful way to attack enemies through walls, but its exact maximum range and overall effectiveness are still yet to be estimated. After all, it's difficult to hit enemies without any visibility at a distance using Hanzo Hattori's basic moveset which has a limited range and a lot of criss-cross movement.

Other observations regarding clones:

- For some reason switching characters while not neutral (i.e. if you are jumping, on horse, etc.) allows you to switch characters without the clones disappearing, allowing other characters to benefit from their presence as well. You cannot switch back to Hanzo Hattori without the clones disappearing, though.

- The clones each have their own unique musou bar which is a copy of Hanzo Hattori's musou bar upon the moment of creation. If they have a full bar, they can do a musou attack, but they can never enter true musou even if you're low on health or have Verity on your weapon.

- You can make a clone get on a ladder. Clones have no collision while they're on the ladder, and any input just makes them drop down. This same input doesn't seem to work for mounting a horse or a war machine with a clone.

- Normally clones disappear when you mount a horse or a war machine, but this limitation is removed after doing the character switch trick. It seems you can't control the clones at all while mounted, though.

- If you try to create clones with a true musou that is also a double musou, no clones become created.

- Clones created during TTA will have a golden glow on them. The glow doesn't end even after TTA ends, they just stay golden until vanishing.

- I tried using some of the other characters' different specials (like Xiahou Ba's speed buff) while the clones are on the field just to see if there would be an interaction, but so far I didn't notice any. The NPC characters generated by the special attacks of Kyubi, Sun Wukong and Yueying remain separate from Hanzo's clones.

## Shuten Doji

• Wonder / Fortitude + Recovery

### Average angled glitch

Shuten Doji can bypass thin walls using either his sprint attack or basic musou attack.

### Average attacking through walls

His air special can hit 5-7 meters through walls.

### Average infinite jump

He can basically hover in place inside an infinite jump chain, but that's it.

### Unique musou

Shuten Doji's musou is preceded by a short animation which makes him grow gigantic. Likewise, he shrinks back to his normal size after his musou is over. These animations are not influenced by weapon speed modifiers - the game might not consider them to be attack animations in the first place.

Growing gigantic doesn't influence Shuten Doji's Speed or collision size. However, it does make the horizontal movement of many of his animations scale up, giving him more general velocity and reach during attacks. This boost also influences the first few frames of his running cycle, allowing him to move around slightly faster when gigantic.

This would be a rather unique way to boost a character's attack-based movement beyond what is normally allowed by Agility, so it's a pity Shuten Doji's movelist doesn't have good, quick "dash" type attacks that would let him convert this into a speed movement tactic or similar. For example, he can gain truly impressive momentary speed if you have 360 Speed and do his air charge attack early from a running jump, but this attack has a lengthy cooldown and you lose most of your speed on staircases because of stairs speed rule anyway, preventing this tactic from working as either speed movement or for sloped floor clipping.

Other observations regarding Shuten Doji's musou:

- Since only horizontal movement is affected, jumping and falling speed don't change from being gigantic.

- Unlike a normal Samurai-style musou, you can't mount a horse during Shuten Doji's musou. However, you CAN climb a ladder, which looks quite amusing with his gigantic size. Mounting a war machine is also not allowed.

- If you start Shuten Doji's musou on horse, he will not grow gigantic at all. It otherwise works the same, though.

- Hitting water or angled surface ends the musou and shrinks Shuten Doji back to normal size immediately. In some circumstances (precise timing?) interrupting the growing or shrinking animation won't instantly cancel it but instead makes Shuten Doji grow or shrink during his normal moveset. However, this lasts a very short time and I'm not sure if you could turn it into some kind of a lasting effect. I tried switching characters during this time, but nothing unusual happened.

### Other notes

Slowing down Shuten Doji's attack speed with Precision + Potency makes his ground and air special hit more times than usual since the damaging effect stays active for longer.


## Xingcai

• Speed / Speed + Recovery

### Top infinite jumper

Xingcai is the 2nd best in the game for horizontal chainable air movement thanks to her fast, forward-propelling air special and double jump. She is only slightly worse in this regard than Yukimura Sanada since her air special's animation is slightly longer and doesn't cross as much distance.

To make up for this, Xingcai is much better at gaining height during infinite jumps compared to Yukimura Sanada - she is arguably in the overall Top 3 in this regard. Her air charge attack gives good height and it can be interrupted with her air special, so it can be incorporated inside an infinite jump combo to gain height faster. And since this additional height comes from a regular attack, it's not subject to random height loss like air specials are, which is really good for jump consistency.

Using the air charge attack can be a bit tricky at first. If you mess up your timing, Xingcai will start her downsmash which makes you lose a lot of height. Still, learning to use it is essential for getting the most out of your infinite jumps with this character.

All of this makes her the most reliable infinite jump team member in the game, good for any kind of a situation. There's rarely any reason not to use her as the other infinite jump character whenever she's available.

### Top angled glitch

Xingcai is able to bypass even thick walls very quickly by using either her ground or air special. Musou and C5 also work for medium-thick walls, although both of these options are slower.

As a side note, she becomes unable to infinite jump effectively while angled because the forward movement in her air special makes her lose all her height.

### Good speed movement

Her ground special makes her ride around on her shield. This movement benefits from Agility and can be sped up with jump cancelling. With Agility 10, this should correspond to around 205 or 210 speed, and as such, it can obsolete a horse. The worst part is that it costs a lot of musou to move around like this.

Repeatedly doing her air special is also a speed movement tactic, although overall this is slightly slower than using the ground special. Might be useful to re-time this.

### Other notes

She can hit a short range through walls using her air special (and maybe musou?) but the range is so short that it's unlikely to help.

The downsmash of her air charge attack has one of the fastest falling speeds in the game. Knowing this might be useful in the rare circumstance where it's necessary to descend quickly.

## Yukimura Sanada

• Speed / Stamina + Impulse

### Top infinite jumper

Yukimura Sanada's most distinguishing feature is his air special which quickly propels him forward around 8 meters in air. It's easily the best air special in the game for chainable horizontal aerial movement, and he has double jump to help out too. Although his height gain is only good instead of great, if you want an infinite jump that wants to cross a long distance quick, he is your #1 person for this purpose.

His favorite team member for quick horizontal infinite jumping is Xingcai, who is the 2nd best in the game for this purpose with her similar forward dashing air special. Alternating their air specials with Agility 10 corresponds to around 240 Speed aerial movement. However, he makes for a surprisingly good pair with any character with a short air special animation, such as Jiang Wei or Zhurong. Although these character don't carry the infinite jump, they allow Yukimura Sanada to spam his exceptional air special that much quicker. Alternating Yukimura Sanada's and Jiang Wei's air specials corresponds to around 200 Speed aerial movement.

### Good speed movement

Before you have maxed out Speed, simply jumping and doing Yukimura Sanada's air special repeatedly offers a fairly efficient hybrid movement style. With Agility 10, this almost corresponds to having 280 Speed, but even without Agility it should be enough to obsolete your horse. The main drawback is that this costs a lot of musou to use.

Alternatively, simply doing C1 to sprint forward, doing two swings and jump cancelling out of the second attack with Agility 10 gives you a nearly 240 Speed hybrid movement without costing any musou.

### Top angled glitch

Yukimura Sanada's air special lets him go under even thick walls with almost no setup, making him one of the most efficient angled glitch characters as well. Alternatively, you can go under medium-thick walls without expending any musou with his sprint attack or C1. Since he is a Samurai-character, you can use him to set up the glitch in full game runs.

He becomes an incredibly bad infinite jumper when angled because you lose all your height every time you do his air special.

### Skill breakpoints

Each use of his air special costs 20 musou. At lv. 1, you can do it 9 times without having to refill your musou. Lv. 10 gives you 11 uses, lv. 17 gives you 12 uses and lv. 25 gives you 13 uses.

### Other notes

His air special can hit a few meters through walls, but it's usually too little to be useful.


## Technical stuff

I've used the following criteria for determining speedrun usefulness:

- Speed movement. How fast a character can move solo. By default, testing takes into account Agility 10 on weapon but assumes default Speed. This is for two reasons: firstly, assuming everyone is at base Speed is more useful for covering original WO3 tactics where upgrade stone duping did not exist. Secondly, Agility 10 is easier to set up in full game runs than 360 Speed, so realistically you'd encounter a situation where a character has Agility on weapon but only base Speed more often than the other way around.
- - 0 = character's maximum speed does not exceed 150. 1 = character's maximum speed is under 200, does not obsolete a horse. 2 = character's maximum speed is over 200, can obsolete a horse. 3 = character can move at Speed cap or go over it. Half a point may be added or removed because of conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can pass Speed cap in steep downhill areas but nowhere else.
 
- Angled glitch. How good a character is for going under walls while angled. Characters who have a convenient access to lengthy non-looping attacks that propel them forward work the best for this purpose.
- - 0 = character cannot pass any kind of walls while angled. 1 = character can pass thin walls while angled. 2 = character can pass medium-thick walls while angled. 3 = character can pass thick walls while angled. Half a point may be added or removed for conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can breach thick walls but the attack for doing so is inconvenient, like the last hit of a slow combo string.
 
- Attacking through walls. How well a character can snipe targets through walls.
- - 0 = character can't hit anything through walls. 1 = character can hit a short distance (2-5 meters) through walls. 2 = character can hit a medium distance (around 5 - 10 meters) through walls. 3 = character can hit a long or even arbitrarily long distance through walls. Note that these meter amounts are just rough estimates. Half a point may be added or removed for conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can hit a long distance through walls, but you need a specific setup to do so.
 
- Solo high jump. What's the highest jump a character can do solo. My testing has been done in Luoyang, where there's a tiered staircase with a ledge above it.
- - 0 = character can't pass the lowest tier in Luoyang. 1 = character can pass the first tier in Luoyang. 2 = character can pass the second tier in Luoyang. 3 = character can skip the staircase and jump up the above ledge from the ground level. Half a point may be added if a character's highest jump is around the middle of two tiers.
 
- Solo long jump. What's the longest jump a character can do solo.
- - 0 = character can jump less than a double jump's worth. 1 = character can jump a double jump's worth. 2 = character can jump triple or quadruple jump's worth. 3 = character can glide or fly for even longer than that.
 
- Team jumping (horizontal). How well a team member can contribute in an infinite jump which needs to have a good horizontal reach.
- - 0 = character is incompatible with infinite jumping. 1 = character can sustain an infinite jump with no real contribution. 2 = character is helpful in an infinite jump. 3 = character is a superb infinite jumper.

- Team jumping (vertical). How well a team member can contribute in an infinite jump that just needs to get height as quick as possible.
- - 0 = character is incompatible with infinite jumping. 1 = character can sustain an infinite jump with no real contribution. 2 = character is helpful in an infinite jump. 3 = character is a superb infinite jumper.
 
- Wallzipping. How good is a character in wallzipping? Zhang He and Xiahou Ba belong in a tier of their own because of their superb speed buff that makes wallzipping more consistent for them than anyone else.
- - 0 = characters who have no wallzip-compatible attacks. 1 = characters who can do a wallzip. 2 = characters who can buff their own speed for more consistent wallzips. 3 = Zhang He and Xiahou Ba.

- Combat setup. Does a character have any tools to save time in combat encounters where you have to wait for enemies to spawn. For instance, Dong Zhuo can leave multiple bombs which can kill multiple officers in different parts of the same room right as they spawn, saving a lot of time compared to another character who would have to take care of them with normal attacks.
- - 0 = no way to setup delayed damage or prepare in any other way. 1 = inconsistent or weak delayed damage or setup. 2 = good delayed damage or setup. 3 = incredible delayed damage or setup.

- Sloped floor clip. Can a character clip through sloped floor?
- - 0 = no way to clip through sloped floor. 1 = very situational sloped floor clip. 2 = better sloped floor clip ability. 3 = best sloped floor clip ability.

It would make this guide a bit dry and unreadable if I included every category for every character, so for now I've just focused on talking about each character's highlights. But perhaps I could add a LibreOffice Calc sheet which lists everyone's numbers at some point, once I've finished testing.
