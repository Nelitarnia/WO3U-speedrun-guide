## Benkei

• Technique / Technique + Dexterity

### Top speed movement

Benkei's biggest asset is his unique air special. This attack features a leap high into the air followed by a quick forward downsmash that leaves him underground in a "digging" state.

This attack uses Benkei's base Speed but also gains a percentage-based bonus from Agility on his weapon, allowing him to break the Speed cap. The average Speed of this technique is hard to estimate, but it's probably in the 420-440 range. It's useful to note that it's not only the grounded digging state which breaks Speed cap but also the aerial downsmash preceding it, so Benkei can fly through the air a very long distance if you set up the right circumstance for it.

Benkei speed digging is explained in more detail [here](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md#Benkei-speed-tech).

This is the most commonly used movement tactic in individual level runs since it's so fast and versatile. It even works in areas with tricky terrain since Benkei can bypass water surface, angled surfaces and ledges while digging. It's harder to utilize in full game runs since it requires you to setup Benkei with a maxed out Speed and Agility 10 first, plus it's quite costly as far as musou is concerned.

### Top high jump

The leap at the start of Benkei's air special gives him a surprising amount of height in a very short span of time, so this attack works as a high jump or a high jump finisher all by itself. Benkei can cross tier 2 in Luoyang staircase solo, which is a feat only a few characters in the game are capable of.

Unfortunately, Benkei can't contribute to infinite jumps in any other capacity since his air special ends in a downsmash which will always end the jump.

### Good angled glitch

Benkei can go past even thick walls with his C3. Additionally, his sprint attack and C7 let him go past up to medium-thick walls. He can be used to setup angled glitch with his Samurai-style musou, although realistically, you'd probably rather use his energy for speed movement.

### Skill breakpoints

Each use of his air special costs 45 musou. At lv. 1, you can do it 3 times without having to refill your musou. Lv. 7 gives you 4 uses, lv. 20+ gives you 5 uses.

### Other notes

Benkei's C2 also makes him dig. It works the same way as the air special, except it has such a slow speed that it generally isn't useful in speedruns. However, it can have a niche use on occasion: one time I got stuck in a pit out of bounds, surrounded by angled surfaces which prevented me from infinite jumping out, but doing C2 let me controllably climb out of the pit instead.

Benkei cannot fall while digging. If you dig over a ledge, Benkei will simply teleport to ground level instantly.

His air special can hit enemies through walls, but at such a short range it's unlikely to be useful.

## Hanzo Hattori

• Speed / Efficacy + Vigor

### Top infinite jump

Hanzo Hattori's air special zips him forward and upward a couple of meters. The animation is short too, allowing it to be done quickly in a jump. He is arguably the best character in the game for chainable vertical air movement, i.e. an infinite jump going for pure height, and maybe in the Top 10 for chainable horizontal air movement too. Having access to double jump is a nice cherry on top.

The worst part is that air specials that are interrupted with a double jump may randomly lose all their height afterwards. This may only happen 10-15% of the time, but it still creates a small degree of inconsistency to vertical infinite jumping. The same is true for almost every other infinite jumping character in the game, though.

### Top high jump

Hanzo Hattori's naturally high ground jump, air special and ability to double jump allow him to gain respectable height even while solo. He can cross tier 2 in Luoyang with double jump -> air special -> double jump.

### Good angled glitch

He can go past up to medium-thick walls with his sprint attack. He can also be used to setup angled glitch.

The forward zip of his air special is not impacted by angle, which allows him to do infinite jumping even while angled.

### Unique clone power

Hanzo Hattori can create two clones of himself using C5. These clones use the same input and have the same speed as the playable character, although their movement does have a few additional limitations. The clones cannot block, double jump, use special moves, turn while attacking or create additional clones with C5. They also disappear after you wait around 10-15 seconds, or even sooner if you switch characters or try to get on horse.

For some reason switching characters while in air, water, slippery collision or climbing a ladder allows you to switch characters without the clones disappearing. After this, you are even able to get on horse without the clones vanishing as well. The clones will always disappear if you try to switch characters back to Hanzo Hattori from any other character, even if you are in air, water, ladder, etc.

Besides increasing Hanzo Hattori's immediate combat power, the clones have two other potentially quite powerful utility in speedruns. First is that he can separate the clones and move them an arbitrary distance away from himself by running against some thin obstacle that doesn't block the clone next to him. It should be possible to snipe officers who spawn with a delay from a great distance away with a far-away clone, which could save navigation time.

Second is that with a precise angle, it's possible to do C5 in a way which spawns a clone through a thin barricade like a garrison gate. This is likely quite a powerful way to attack enemies through walls, although it should be tested in practice to see just how effective it actually is.

Other observations regarding clones:

• The clones are able to do musou. The clones' musou gauge is probably shared with Hanzo himself, so at high levels they can endlessly spam musou as long as they remain on the map.

• You can make a clone get on a ladder. Clones have no collision while they're on the ladder, and any input just makes them drop down. This same trick doesn't seem to work for mounting a horse or a war machine with a clone.

• Normally clones disappear when you're on a war machine, but if you did the character switch trick, they will stay active instead. It seems you can't control the clones at all while on a war machine, though.

• Clones created during TTA will have a golden glow on them. The glow doesn't end even after TTA ends, they just stay golden until vanishing.

• The characters generated by the special attacks of Kyubi, Sun Wukong and Yueying remain separate from Hanzo's clones.

• I tried using various characters' different specials (like Xiahou Ba's speed buff) while the clones are on the field just to see if there would be an interaction, but so far I didn't notice any.

### Other notes

Hanzo Hattori is able to breach some sloped floor since his air special gives him such a high velocity forward zip. However, it's difficult to stay out of bounds afterwards because the air special also gives him a lot of height and usually pushes him back up above ground level. He needs very steep angled floor (or to save & reload mid-attack) for this to work.

## Yukimura Sanada

• Speed / Stamina + Impulse

### Top infinite jumper

Yukimura Sanada is a very useful team member with a lot of different utility. His most unique feature is his air special which quickly propels him forward around 8 meters in air. It's easily the best air special in the game for chainable horizontal aerial movement, and he has a double jump to help too. Although his height gain is only good instead of great, if you want an infinite jump that wants to cross a long distance quick, he is your #1 person for this purpose.

His favorite team member for quick horizontal infinite jumping is Xingcai, who is the 2nd best in the game for this purpose with her similar forward dashing air special. Alternating their air specials with Agility 10 corresponds to around 240 Speed aerial movement. However, he makes for a surprisingly good pair with any character with a short air special animation, such as Jiang Wei or Zhurong. Although these character don't carry the infinite jump, they allow Yukimura Sanada to spam his exceptional air special that much quicker. Alternating Yukimura Sanada's and Jiang Wei's air specials corresponds to around 200 Speed aerial movement.

### Good speed movement

Before you have maxed out Speed, simply jumping and doing Yukimura Sanada's air special repeatedly offers a fairly efficient hybrid movement style. With Agility 10, this almost corresponds to having 280 Speed, but even without Agility it should be enough to obsolete your horse. The main drawback is that this costs a lot of musou to use.

Alternatively, simply doing C1 to sprint forward, doing two swings and jump cancelling out of the second attack with Agility 10 gives you a nearly 240 Speed hybrid movement without costing any musou.

### Top angled glitch

Yukimura Sanada's air special lets him go under even thick walls with almost no setup, making him one of the most efficient angled glitch characters as well. Alternatively, you can go under medium-thick walls without expending any musou with his sprint attack or C1. Since he is a Samurai-character, you can use him to set up the glitch in full game runs.

He becomes an incredibly bad infinite jumper when angled because you lose all your height every time you do his air special.

### Skill breakpoints

Each use of his air special costs 20 musou. At lv. 1, you can do it 9 times without having to refill your musou. Lv. 10 gives you 11 uses, lv. 17 gives you 12 uses and lv. 25 gives you 13 uses.

### Other notes

His air special can technically hit a few meters through walls, but it's usually too little to be useful.


## Technical stuff

I've used the following criteria for determining speedrun usefulness:

- Speed movement. How fast a character can move solo. By default, testing takes into account Agility 10 on weapon but assumes default Speed. This is for two reasons: firstly, assuming everyone is at base Speed is more useful for covering original WO3 tactics where upgrade stone duping did not exist. Secondly, Agility 10 is easier to set up in full game runs than 360 Speed, so realistically you'd encounter a situation where a character has Agility on weapon but only base Speed more often than the other way around.
- - 0 = character's maximum speed does not exceed 150. 1 = character's maximum speed is under 200, does not obsolete a horse. 2 = character's maximum speed is over 200, can obsolete a horse. 3 = character can move at Speed cap or go over it. Half a point may be added or removed because of conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can pass Speed cap in steep downhill areas but nowhere else.
 
- Angled glitch. How good a character is for going under walls while angled. Characters who have a convenient access to lengthy non-looping attacks that propel them forward work the best for this purpose.
- - 0 = character cannot pass any kind of walls while angled. 1 = character can pass thin walls while angled. 2 = character can pass medium-thick walls while angled. 3 = character can pass thick walls while angled. Half a point may be added or removed for conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can breach thick walls but the attack for doing so is inconvenient, like the last hit of a slow combo string.
 
- Attacking through walls. How well a character can snipe targets through walls.
- - 0 = character can't hit anything through walls. 1 = character can hit a short distance (2-5 meters) through walls. 2 = character can hit a medium distance (around 5 - 10 meters) through walls. 3 = character can hit a long or even arbitrarily long distance through walls. Note that these meter amounts are just rough estimates. Half a point may be added or removed for conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can hit a long distance through walls, but you need a specific setup to do so.
 
- Solo high jump. What's the highest jump a character can do solo. My testing has been done in Luoyang, where there's a tiered staircase with a ledge above it.
- - 0 = character can't pass the lowest tier in Luoyang. 1 = character can pass the first tier in Luoyang. 2 = character can pass the second tier in Luoyang. 3 = character can skip the staircase and jump up the above ledge from the ground level. Half a point may be added if a character's highest jump is around the middle of two tiers.
 
- Solo long jump. What's the longest jump a character can do solo.
- - 0 = character can jump less than a double jump's worth. 1 = character can jump a double jump's worth. 2 = character can jump triple or quadruple jump's worth. 3 = character can glide or fly for even longer than that.
 
- Team jumping (horizontal). How well a team member can contribute in an infinite jump which needs to have a good horizontal reach.
- - 0 = character is incompatible with infinite jumping. 1 = character can sustain an infinite jump with no real contribution. 2 = character is helpful in an infinite jump. 3 = character is a superb infinite jumper.

- Team jumping (vertical). How well a team member can contribute in an infinite jump that just needs to get height as quick as possible.
- - 0 = character is incompatible with infinite jumping. 1 = character can sustain an infinite jump with no real contribution. 2 = character is helpful in an infinite jump. 3 = character is a superb infinite jumper.
 
- Wallzipping. How good is a character in wallzipping? Zhang He and Xiahou Ba belong in a tier of their own because of their superb speed buff that makes wallzipping more consistent for them than anyone else.
- - 0 = characters who have no wallzip-compatible attacks. 1 = characters who can do a wallzip. 2 = characters who can buff their own speed for more consistent wallzips. 3 = Zhang He and Xiahou Ba.

- Combat setup. Does a character have any tools to save time in combat encounters where you have to wait for enemies to spawn. For instance, Dong Zhuo can leave multiple bombs which can kill multiple officers in different parts of the same room right as they spawn, saving a lot of time compared to another character who would have to take care of them with normal attacks.
- - 0 = no way to setup delayed damage or prepare in any other way. 1 = inconsistent or weak delayed damage or setup. 2 = good delayed damage or setup. 3 = incredible delayed damage or setup.

- Sloped floor clip. Can a character clip through sloped floor?
- - 0 = no way to clip through sloped floor. 1 = very situational sloped floor clip. 2 = better sloped floor clip ability. 3 = best sloped floor clip ability.

It would make this guide a bit dry and unreadable if I included every category for every character, so for now I've just focused on talking about each character's highlights. But perhaps I could add a LibreOffice Calc sheet which lists everyone's numbers at some point, once I've finished testing.
