# Individual character notes

This section takes an in-depth look at each character in the game from the perspective of speedrun utility. Still a work-in-progress...

It's recommended to read the terminology and glitch tech sections of the [the main WO3U speedrun guide](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md) first because their terms and ideas will be mentioned quite often in the below sections. There's also more elaboration on the process with which I evaluated the characters at the [end of the file](#Technical-stuff).

## Benkei

• Technique / Technique + Dexterity

### Average attacking through walls

Benkei's air special can hit enemies through walls, but at such a short range it's unlikely to be useful.

### Great angled glitch

Benkei can go past even thick walls with his C3 while angled. Additionally, his sprint attack and C7 allow him go past up to medium-thick walls. Since he has a Samurai-style musou, he can also be used to setup angled glitch, although realistically, you'd probably rather use his energy for speed movement.

### Great high jump

The leap at the start of Benkei's air special gives him a surprising amount of height in a very short span of time, so this attack works as a high jump or a high jump finisher all by itself. Benkei can cross tier 2 in Luoyang staircase solo, which is a feat only a few characters in the game are capable of.

### Top speed movement

Benkei's air special makes him leap high into the air followed by a quick forward downsmash that leaves him underground in a "digging" state. This action uses Benkei's base Speed and it also gains a percentage-based Speed bonus from Agility 10. Since Agility can give a character up to a 17% attack speed boost, a quick calculation would suggest that the maximum Speed of this movement is 421,2. However, in practice the average Speed is slightly slower than that since the air special does have some cooldown between uses.

Benkei speed digging is explained in more detail [here](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md#Benkei-speed-tech).

This is the most commonly used movement tactic in individual level runs since it's so fast and versatile. It even works in areas with tricky terrain since Benkei can bypass water surface, angled surfaces and ledges while digging. However, it's harder to utilize in full game runs since it requires you to setup Benkei with a maxed out Speed and Agility 10 first, plus it's quite costly as far as musou is concerned.

### Skill breakpoints

Each use of his air special costs 45 musou. At lv. 1, you can do it 3 times without having to refill your musou. At lv. 7 you get 4 uses, lv. 20+ you get 5 uses, lv. 100, you get 9 uses.

### Other notes

Benkei can't contribute to infinite jumps in any other capacity than as a jump finisher since his air special ends in a downsmash. This also prevents him from doing a good wallzip.

Benkei's C2 also makes him dig. It works the same way as the air special, except it has such a slow speed that it generally isn't useful in speedruns. However, the fact that you can do it while grounded without having to move much can occasionally give it a niche use: one time I got stuck in a pit out of bounds, surrounded by angled surfaces which prevented me from infinite jumping or using Benkei's air special to get out, but doing C2 let me controllably climb out of the pit instead.

Benkei cannot fall while digging. If you dig over a ledge, Benkei will simply teleport to ground level instantly.

## Cai Wenji

• Wonder / Wonder + Impact

### Average angled glitch

She can bypass thin obstacles while angled using her sprint attack.

### Average high jump

Her highest known jump is jump -> air charge attack. This is enough to cross tier 1 in Luoyang.

### Average infinite jump

Her air special is rather slow, but it lets her hover in place as a part of an infinite jump chain.

### Average combat setup

Her EX causes damaging projectiles to fall from the sky for around 5 seconds while she is free to move and do attacks. Doing it pre-emptively might help to prepare for a fight somewhere, although I would assume the damage from the falling projectiles is largely inconsistent.

### Neutral L-stick bug

Her regular air attack has a [neutral L-stick bug](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md#Neutral-L-stick-bugs) and it can gain extreme forward velocity (rivalling Zuo Ci) if you do it from a running jump and leave L-stick neutral. This only works on vsync 30, and it's somewhat hard to utilize effectively since you need a lot of starting height to really benefit from the glitchy speed.

### Other notes

She has no known way to attack through walls.

Her air charge attack features a flashy looking somersault through the air. Unfortunately, most of its apparent height gain is fake, so it can't be used in Save & Quit infinite jumps very effectively.

Cai Wenji gains an aura around her after doing her EX. I'm not sure if this is an actual buff, or if it's just an indication that the falling projectile effect is active.

## Cao Cao

• Technique / Impact + Stamina

### Good angled glitch

He can bypass up to medium-thick obstacles while angled with his sprint attack or C6.

### Good attacking through walls

The projectiles fired by his air special fly through walls and can hit up to around 10 meters. The range is extended even further if you do the attack higher in air.

### Good high jump

His highest know jump is jump -> air special -> air charge attack, which is enough to jump up from the half-way point between tiers 1 and 2 in Luoyang.

### Average infinite jump

Cao Cao's air special helps him hover and also gives slight height inside an infinite jump chain. You don't fall very quickly after the air special, which makes it slightly more consistent than you'd expect, but still not truly useful.

### Average combat setup

His ground special leaves a kind of a force field which lingers a few seconds after the attack animation has ended, potentially allowing slight multi-tasking.

## Cao Pi

• Speed / Focus + Fellowship

### Great angled glitch

Cao Pi can bypass even thick walls by using his sprint attack while angled. C3 and C4 also work for medium-thick walls. Ground special and C6 additionally work for thin walls.

### Average attacking through walls

Air special can hit a short distance through walls.

### Average high jump

Cao Pi has natural access to double jump. His air charge attack can also give him some height while also moving him backwards. His highest known jump is double jump -> air charge attack (turning away from the wall), which is enough to cross tier 1 and around 4 steps in Luoyang.

### Average speed movement

Double jumping everywhere allows Cao Pi to move much faster than his default 135 Speed. Still, like all double jumping movement tactics, this doesn't obsolete horse.

### Situational wallzip

Cao Pi can't use his air special to do a good wallzip, but his air charge attack is lengthy enough that it can actually give decent height. The worst part is that you can't chain it into anything else afterwards, but it might still come in handy in classic WO3 where air specials aren't available.

### Average sloped floor clip

The fast movement in his C3 is enough to clip through sloped floor with Agility 10. But it's not as powerful as Jia Xu's C1 zip, and I haven't been able to clip Anegawa stairs with it.

Ground special also has a zip, but it doesn't seem to be fast enough to even clip through Nanzhong stairs.

### Other notes

He can't contribute to infinite jumps because his air special ends in a downsmash.

If you interrupt his air special with angled floor, the projectile continues flying by itself until it reaches ground.

## Cao Ren

• Power / Fortitude + Power

### Good angled glitch

He can bypass up to medium-thick walls by using his sprint attack while angled.

### Average infinite jump

He can hover as a part of an infinite jump chain with his air special. The air special is quite fast, so he can be a decent team mate when paired with an actually good infinite jumping character.

### Other notes

He doesn't have a way to attack through walls.

He is one of the least acrobatic characters in the game, with a rather low regular jump and no good ways to extend it. His air charge attack responds to air momentum and can give him a little extra height if done early in the jump, but it doesn't help much.

His C6 has the same "magnetic" effect as Xu Huang's attacks.

## Dian Wei

• Power / Potence + Fortitude

### Good angled glitch

He can bypass up to medium-thick walls with his sprint attack or ground special while angled.

### Average attacking through walls

The axe throw of his air special can hit a few meters through walls.

### Average high jump

His highest known jump is jump -> air charge attack, which is enough to cross around 1 tier and 2 steps in Luoyang.

### Average combat setup

He can buff his attacks with explosion effects using his EX, although I'm not sure if this offers a straight damage increase or adds a crowd damage effect to his attacks. Regardless, it might come in handy in some combat scenario.

### Other notes

He can't contribute to infinite jumps since his air special ends in a downsmash. This makes him bad for wallzipping as well. He actually gains a surprising amount of height during a wallzip before the downsmash and he *could* probably get over some wall with it, but the lack of steering while in air makes utilizing the extra height that much more difficult. Overall, you'd have to be quite desperate to consider using Dian Wei for a wallzip.

## Hanzo Hattori

• Speed / Efficacy + Vigor

### Good angled glitch

He can go past up to medium-thick walls with his sprint attack. He can also be used to setup angled glitch since he is a Samurai-style character.

As a side note, the forward zip of his air special is not impacted by angle, which allows him to be a good infinite jumper even while angled.

### Top infinite jump

Hanzo Hattori is arguably the best character in the game for chainable vertical air movement, and maybe in the Top 10 for chainable horizontal air movement too. His air special zips him forward and upward a couple of meters. The animation is short too, allowing it to be repeated quickly in a jump, and having access to double jump is just a cherry on top.

### Top high jump

Hanzo Hattori's naturally high ground jump, air special and ability to double jump allow him to gain respectable height even while solo. He can cross tier 2 in Luoyang with double jump -> air special -> double jump.

### Average speed movement

Double jumping everywhere allows him to move faster than his default 150 Speed. Still, like all double jumping movement tactics, this doesn't obsolete horse.

### Average sloped floor clip

Hanzo Hattori is able to breach some sloped floor with his air special which allows him to do a controllable forward zip. However, it's difficult to stay out of bounds afterwards because the air special also gives him a lot of height and usually pushes him back up above ground level. He needs very steep angled floor (or to save & reload mid-attack) for this to work.

Alternatively, his true musou makes him zip around at a high enough velocity that he can clip sloped floor. To have the right angle, turn Hanzo Hattori so that he is facing away from the direction you want to clip. Clipping through something like the staircases in Nanzhong is easy, but I couldn't get this to work on smaller staircases in Anegawa. This tactic might be a bit too uncontrollable for precision clips, or perhaps it just needs a better setup.

### Unique clone power

Hanzo Hattori can create two clones of himself using C5 or true musou. These clones are controlled with the same input as the playable character, although their movement does have a few additional limitations. The clones cannot block, double jump, use special moves, turn while attacking or create additional clones with C5. They also disappear after you wait around 10-15 seconds, or even sooner if you switch characters, try to get on horse or the true musou finishing move is about to start.

The clones have the same Speed as Hanzo Hattori. Attack speed as influenced by Agility, Precision and Potency is copied to the clones too, but many other weapon properties (like Multi, Typhoon, etc.) don't seem to work on the clones. If Hanzo Hattori is angled or "soul split", the created clones will be likewise glitched.

Besides increasing Hanzo Hattori's immediate combat power, the clones have two other potentially quite powerful utility in speedruns. First is that the clones can be separated to cover a larger range with their attacks. It should even be possible to defeat officers from a great distance away with a separated clone, which could save navigation time.

Second is that with a precise positioning, it's possible to spawn clones through thin walls like garrison gates. Using C5 for this requires precise positioning, but it seems quite easy if you activate true musou instead. This is likely quite a powerful way to attack enemies through walls, but its exact maximum range and overall effectiveness are still yet to be estimated. After all, it's difficult to hit enemies without any visibility at a distance using Hanzo Hattori's basic moveset which has a limited range and a lot of criss-cross movement.

Other observations regarding clones:

- For some reason switching characters while not neutral (i.e. if you are jumping, on horse, etc.) allows you to switch characters without the clones disappearing, allowing other characters to benefit from their presence as well. You cannot switch back to Hanzo Hattori without the clones disappearing, though.

- The clones each have their own unique musou bar which is a copy of Hanzo Hattori's musou bar upon the moment of creation. If they have a full bar, they can do a musou attack, but they can never enter true musou even if you're low on health or have Verity on your weapon.

- You can make a clone get on a ladder. Clones have no collision while they're on the ladder, and any input just makes them drop down. This same input doesn't seem to work for mounting a horse or a war machine with a clone.

- Normally clones disappear when you mount a horse or a war machine, but this limitation is removed after doing the character switch trick. It seems you can't control the clones at all while mounted, though.

- If you try to create clones with a true musou that is also a double musou, no clones become created.

- Clones created during TTA will have a golden glow on them. The glow doesn't end even after TTA ends, they just stay golden until vanishing.

- I tried using some of the other characters' different specials (like Xiahou Ba's speed buff) while the clones are on the field just to see if there would be an interaction, but so far I didn't notice any. The NPC characters generated by the special attacks of Kyubi, Sun Wukong and Yueying remain separate from Hanzo's clones.

## Jia Xu

• Speed / Dexterity + Solidarity

### Good angled glitch

Jia Xu can bypass up to medium-thick walls using either his sprint attack or air special.

### Average attacking through walls

His air special can hit 1-2 meters through walls, which is probably too little to be of much help.

### Good high jump

Jia Xu has access to double jump. Furthermore, both his regular and charge air attacks give height, although to me it seems the regular attack is more consistent for gaining height and going over ledges. His highest known jump is double jump -> air special -> double jump -> regular air attack, which lets him cross from slightly over the half-way point between tiers 1 and 2 in Luoyang.

### Average/Great infinite jump

Jia Xu's air special doesn't give him much height, but it does propel him forward and is probably in the Top 5 best horizontal infinite jump moves. Double jump gives him a lot of consistency too. He's a solid supporting character for either type of a jump, but truly useful only for horizontal jumps.

### Average speed movement

He has access to double jumps, which naturally allows him to go faster than his default 135 Speed. This speed movement might become more powerful if you do C1 before each double jump.

### Top sloped floor clip

Jia Xu's C1 has an incredibly fast forward velocity for a short amount of time, and you can easily clip through sloped floor by doing it. Any ground that's less steep than 45 degrees probably won't work, but Jia Xu CAN even clip short staircases like the ones in Anegawa or Honnoji. He is overall not as consistent as Taigong Wang as far as sloped floor clipping is concerned, but the forward movement of C1 also allows him to go under some gates that are adjacent to sloped floor, like one of the gates in Mystic Realm, which gives him some unique utility.

### Other notes

The zip-like forward movement of C1 is so fast that when done off a ledge, the game thinks Jia Xu is on ground an extra frame or two even though he is already in air. This lets you try doing a ground special or a musou while airborne. These moves may get immediately cancelled by gravity, but with a specific timing, Jia Xu will instead immediately warp down to ground level before doing the move like normal. You can even go under water surface using this trick.

Doing TTA in air is also possible, and this makes the TTA begin in a slightly glitchy way. Jia Xu won't teleport to ground level but instead falls down normally as TTA becomes active. However, the scene which stops time and shows your team members up close will only appear at an arbitrary time, after a few seconds has passed. The appearance of the close-up scene can be further delayed by being in air, or so it seems.

I also tried doing double musou like this, but Jia Xu's position was reversed back to where it was before C1 as the double musou scene started, preventing it from being done in air.

I tried if you could do a Xu Shu-style incredibly high velocity air attack by doing C1 off a ledge, then double jumping and frame precisely air attacking out of it, but all I got was an air attack with a regular double jump speed.

## Shuten Doji

• Wonder / Fortitude + Recovery

### Average angled glitch

Shuten Doji can bypass thin walls using either his sprint attack or basic musou attack.

### Average attacking through walls

His air special can hit 5-7 meters through walls.

### Average infinite jump

He can basically hover in place inside an infinite jump chain, but that's it.

### Unique musou

Shuten Doji's musou is preceded by a short animation which makes him grow gigantic. Likewise, he shrinks back to his normal size after his musou is over. These animations are not influenced by weapon speed modifiers - the game might not consider them to be attack animations in the first place.

Growing gigantic doesn't influence Shuten Doji's Speed or collision size. However, it does make the horizontal movement of many of his animations scale up, giving him more general velocity and reach during attacks. This boost also influences the first few frames of his running cycle, allowing him to move around slightly faster when gigantic.

This would be a rather unique way to boost a character's attack-based movement beyond what is normally allowed by Agility, so it's a pity Shuten Doji's movelist doesn't have good, quick "dash" type attacks that would let him convert this into a speed movement tactic or similar. For example, he can gain truly impressive momentary speed if you have 360 Speed and do his air charge attack early from a running jump, but this attack has a lengthy cooldown and you lose most of your speed on staircases because of stairs speed rule anyway, preventing this tactic from working as either speed movement or for sloped floor clipping.

Other observations regarding Shuten Doji's musou:

- Since only horizontal movement is affected, jumping and falling speed don't change from being gigantic.

- Unlike a normal Samurai-style musou, you can't mount a horse during Shuten Doji's musou. However, you CAN climb a ladder, which looks quite amusing with his gigantic size. Mounting a war machine is also not allowed.

- If you start Shuten Doji's musou on horse, he will not grow gigantic at all. It otherwise works the same, though.

- Hitting water or angled surface ends the musou and shrinks Shuten Doji back to normal size immediately. In some circumstances (precise timing?) interrupting the growing or shrinking animation won't instantly cancel it but instead makes Shuten Doji grow or shrink during his normal moveset. However, this lasts a very short time and I'm not sure if you could turn it into some kind of a lasting effect. I tried switching characters during this time, but nothing unusual happened.

### Other notes

Slowing down Shuten Doji's attack speed with Precision + Potency makes his ground and air special hit more times than usual since the damaging effect stays active for longer.

## Taishi Ci

• Power / Stamina + Vigor

### Average angled glitch

You can breach thin obstacles while angled with either sprint attack or C6.

### Average attacking through walls

The shockwave of the air special hits a few meters past walls.

### Good high jump

His highest solo jump is jump -> air charge attack -> air special -> air charge attack. It allows him to pass over the half-way point between tier 1 and tier 2.

### Good infinite jump

Taishi Ci is actually a surprisingly solid infinite jump team member. His air special has a fairly quick animation and it gives height in an infinite jump combo. Furthermore, he is able to use air charge attack before each air special to gain a bit of 100% consistent extra height per cycle. The only drawbacks are that he doesn't have a double jump and also that he doesn't have a lot of musou to spare for jumps at low level.

### Other notes

Taishi Ci has one of the most damaging musou-attacks of all the early game characters, which makes him quite useful for combat in any% runs.

## Xiahou Dun

• Power / Trinity + Potence

### Good angled glitch

Xiahou Dun can bypass up to medium-thick walls while angled using his sprint attack.

### Top attacking through walls

Xiahou Dun's air special fires a wide, cross-shaped projectile with a mild downward angle. It catches any enemies in its range, hitting them multiple times and pushing them away over its impressive range of over 20 meters.

The projectile passes freely through walls, so it can be used for officer sniping from a distance. However, each individual hit of the air special only does low damage. Its pushback also re-positions enemies, which might make it challenging to hit a single target with multiple air specials in a row. You probably need to setup Xiahou Dun first by getting his lv. 5 weapon and infusing the weapon attributes Aerial and Frenzy, and even then I'm slightly skeptical of this attack's ability to work as a quick solution against more powerful enemies. Like all officer sniping tactics, it's mostly relevant for individual level runs on lower difficulties.

### Average high jump

Xiahou Dun's highest known solo jump is jump -> air charge attack. It gets 1 tier and around 4 steps worth of height at Luoyang.

### Average infinite jump

Xiahou Dun can hover and move slowly forward as a part of infinite jump combos.

### Average combat setup

His air special creates lingering long-range damage that gives Xiahou Dun a bit of extra flexibility in dealing with late spawning officers. The damage could be better, though.

### Other notes

Xiahou Dun falls down very quickly during the downsmash of his air charge attack. Might be useful to know if you ever need to fall fast.

His air special hits huge crowds of enemies at once, which makes him great for farming on Gauntlet-mode.

## Xiahou Yuan

• Wonder / Vigor + Efficacy

### Good angled glitch

Xiahou Yuan can get past medium-thick walls with C4 while angled. Sprint attack, C1 and C2 also work for thin walls.

### Great attacking through walls

Xiahou Yuan can be an excellent officer sniping character, although he does require some setup to work. His air special fires an exploding arrow which flies downward at around 45 degree angle. This projectile has no range limit and it can pass through walls. The range of the air special isn't that impressive when done near ground level, but the range dramatically increases if you do it from higher up in air. So, pairing Xiahou Yuan with a wallzip character or two infinite jumpers lets you hit officers from up to tens of meters away. I haven't tried this much in practice so I can't comment on the damage, but this tactic can insta-kill officers on NG+ conditions in the early chapters, at least.

### Good high jump

His highest jump so far is C5 (sideways or back against wall) -> air special (at top height) -> regular air attack (turning towards wall). This is enough to cross tier 1 and around 5 steps in Luoyang.

### Average infinite jump

He can be used as a part of an infinite jump combo to at least hover in place.

### Top speed movement

Xiahou Yuan's regular air attack has a [neutral L-stick bug](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md#Neutral-L-stick-bugs). If you do it from a running jump with L-stick neutral, you'll see Xiahou Yuan's speed exponentially increase (up to a certain limit), causing him to fly forward a huge distance in air. This is an extremely fast hybrid speed movement that doesn't cost any musou that can situationally be even faster than Benkei. It requires less setup to be effective too.

There's more about this speed movement tactic [here](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md#Xiahou-Yuan-speed-tech).

### Top sloped floor clip

Xiahou Yuan can clip through longer normal staircases (like in Nanzhong) using his C5 downsmash.

Besides that, his bugged regular air attack gives him such a high velocity that he can clip through almost any kind of sloped floor that is not limited by the stairs speed rule, f.e. something like the various mildly inclined walkways in Escape from the Mirror Realm. Although he is only average in clipping through actual stairs, he can do things in this department that no other character in the game can.

### Good combat setup

His long-range officer sniping ability could allow him to save time in some combat scenario. He can also cause a short-ranged delayed damage effect using his ground special for multi-tasking purposes.

### Other notes

If you do the C5 downsmash past a ledge, the animation will not continue indefinitely but instead interrupts in air maybe 0.5 meters below where you started.

## Xingcai

• Speed / Speed + Recovery

### Average attacking through walls

She can hit a short range through walls using her air special (and maybe musou?) but the range is so short that it's unlikely to help.

### Top angled glitch

Xingcai is able to bypass even thick walls very quickly by using either her ground or air special. Musou and C5 also work for medium-thick walls, although both of these options are slower.

As a side note, she becomes unable to infinite jump effectively while angled because the forward movement in her air special makes her lose a lot of height.

### Great high jump

Xingcai has a naturally high jump and it can be extended with double jump as well. Her air charge attack and air special are also helpful for gaining height.

Her highest known solo jump is double jump -> charge air attack -> air special -> jump -> charge air attack. This is enough to cross tier 2 and about 5 steps at Luoyang.

### Top infinite jump

Xingcai is the 2nd best in the game for horizontal chainable air movement thanks to her fast, forward-propelling air special and double jump. She is only slightly worse in this regard than Yukimura Sanada since her air special's animation is slightly longer and doesn't cross as much distance.

To make up for this, Xingcai is much better at gaining height during infinite jumps compared to Yukimura Sanada - she is arguably in the overall Top 3 in this regard. Her air charge attack gives good height and it can be interrupted with her air special, so it can be incorporated inside an infinite jump combo to gain height faster. And since this additional height comes from a regular attack, it's not subject to random height loss like air specials are, which is really good for jump consistency.

Using the air charge attack can be a bit tricky at first. If you mess up your timing, Xingcai will start her downsmash which makes you lose a lot of height. Still, learning to use it is essential for getting the most out of your infinite jumps with this character.

All of this makes her the most reliable infinite jump team member in the game, good for any kind of a situation. There's rarely any reason not to use her as the other infinite jump character whenever she's available.

### Good speed movement

Her ground special makes her ride around on her shield. This movement benefits from Agility and can be sped up with jump cancelling. With Agility 10, this should correspond to around 205 or 210 speed, and as such, it can obsolete a horse. The worst part is that it costs a lot of musou to move around like this.

Repeatedly doing her air special is also a speed movement tactic, although overall this is slightly slower than using the ground special. Might be useful to re-time this.

Double jumping everywhere allows her to move much faster than her default 135 Speed, which could be a decent back-up movement if you're out of musou.

### Other notes

The downsmash of her air charge attack has one of the fastest falling speeds in the game. Knowing this might be useful in the rare circumstance where it's necessary to descend quickly.

## Xu Huang

• Power / Solidarity + Vitality

### Good angled glitch

Xu Huang can bypass up to medium-thick walls while angled with his sprint attack. C1 works on thin obstacles as well.

### Average attacking through walls

The last hit of his air special can hit a few meters through walls.

### Average high jump

His highest known jump is jump -> air special, which is enough to pass tier 1 and 3 steps in Luoyang.

### Average speed movement

Xu Huang has an air special that ends in a droopy downsmash, and he can fly quite a long distance through air with it. With Agility 10, the maximum speed of the air special is close to Speed cap. However, you need quite a specific circumstance and a lot of height to truly benefit from this tactic because of its fairly high musou cost and slow wind-up time. This works equally well on any vsync.

### Unique magnetic attacks

Most of Xu Huang's basic attacks magnetically grab enemies. Only a few characters in the game have access to this effect. If you equip Xu Huang with a low attack power weapon, you can use his attacks to toss enemies around and move them a surprisingly long distance. Perhaps something like this could save time in a level where you have to specifically manipulate a hostile enemy officer's location without them dying, although so far this is strictly theoretical.

### Other notes

Xu Huang can't participate in infinite jumps nor do wallclimbing due to his downsmash air special.

## Xu Zhu

• Power / Vitality + Acclaim

### Good angled glitch

Xu Zhu is able to bypass up to medium-thick walls with his sprint attack, EX or C4 while angled.

### Average attacking through walls

The final impact of his air special reaches a short distance through walls.

### Average high jump

Xu Zhu's normal jump is low, but he can gain a bit of extra height with his air special, enough to cross tier 1 and 2 steps at Luoyang.

He can situationally do an even higher jump with his C4 attack. If you drop off a ledge during the part where Xu Zhu is high in air, the attack interrupts but you get to keep his current height.

### Other notes

He can't contribute to infinite jumps since his air special ends in a downsmash. This also limits his wallzipping ability, but he can gain at least around 6-8 meters of height and steer while falling down after doing a wallzip. This might be enough to go over a low wall somewhere, but generally I wouldn't advise trying to use Xu Zhu for wallzips.

## Yukimura Sanada

• Speed / Stamina + Impulse

### Top angled glitch

Yukimura Sanada's air special lets him go under even thick walls with almost no setup while angled, making him one of the most efficient angled glitch characters. Alternatively, you can go under medium-thick walls without expending any musou with his sprint attack or C1. Since he is a Samurai-character, you can use him to set up the glitch in full game runs.

To note, he becomes an incredibly bad infinite jumper when angled because you lose all your height every time you do his air special.

### Good high jump

His highest known solo jump is double jump -> air special -> double jump. This is enough to cross tier 1 and about 5 steps in Luoyang.

### Top infinite jump

Yukimura Sanada's most distinguishing feature is his air special which quickly propels him forward around 8 meters in air. It's easily the best air special in the game for chainable horizontal aerial movement, and he has double jump to help out too. Although his height gain is only good instead of great, if you want an infinite jump that wants to cross a long distance quick, he is your #1 person for this purpose.

His favorite team member for quick horizontal infinite jumping is Xingcai, who is the 2nd best in the game for this purpose with her similar forward dashing air special. Alternating their air specials with Agility 10 corresponds to around 240 Speed aerial movement. However, he makes for a surprisingly good pair with any character with a short air special animation, such as Jiang Wei or Zhurong. Although these character don't carry the infinite jump, they allow Yukimura Sanada to spam his exceptional air special that much quicker. Alternating Yukimura Sanada's and Jiang Wei's air specials corresponds to around 200 Speed aerial movement.

### Good speed movement

Before you have maxed out Speed, simply jumping and doing Yukimura Sanada's air special repeatedly offers a fairly efficient hybrid movement style. With Agility 10, this almost corresponds to having 280 Speed, but even without Agility it should be enough to obsolete your horse. The main drawback is that this costs a lot of musou to use.

Alternatively, simply doing C1 to sprint forward, doing two swings and jump cancelling out of the second attack with Agility 10 gives you a nearly 240 Speed hybrid movement without costing any musou.

He can also simply double jump everywhere to move at a decent speed without any musou costs, but the C1 movement tactic should be superior if the terrain simply allows it.

### Skill breakpoints

Each use of his air special costs 20 musou. At lv. 1, you can do it 9 times without having to refill your musou. Lv. 10 gives you 11 uses, lv. 17 gives you 12 uses and lv. 25 gives you 13 uses.

### Other notes

His air special can hit a few meters through walls, but it's usually too little to be useful.

## Zhang He

• Wonder / Impulse + Focus

### Great angled glitch

He is able to bypass even thick walls while angled using his EX. Additionally, his musou and C5 also work for medium-thick walls and sprint attack and C6 work for thin walls.

### Great high jump

Zhang He's regular jump is naturally quite high. Furthermore, his three-hit regular air attack combo gives him extra height, and he can also interrupt the combo with his air special to do it twice during a single jump. Also, his EX is a launcher which gives him more height than a regular jump.

His highest known solo jump is EX -> regular air attack string -> 3rd hit interrupted with special -> another air attack string -> 3rd hit interrupted with charge attack. This is enough to easily cross tier 2 and even more in Luoyang.

### Good infinite jump

He can use his air attacks and air special to hover and move forward during an infinite jump combo. His regular air attack combo can give him some guaranteed height each jump cycle. However, he tends to fall down quite fast after his air special since his speed will be buffed, which is something to be wary of.

### Great speed movement

Zhang He can buff his own speed using his air special. He and Xiahou Ba share an especially powerful speed buff which seems to double their animation speed for around 10 seconds.

There's more about using this speed movement technique [here](https://github.com/Nelitarnia/WO3U-speedrun-guide/blob/main/WO3U-speedrun-guide.md#Speed-buffing).

### Top wallzip

Zhang He is the ultimate wallzipping character in this game. The main reason for this is his powerful speed buff which makes wallzipping easier to perform. It's still not nearly 100% consistent, but he and Xiahou Ba are as good as it gets as far as this finicky technique is concerned. Overall, I prefer Zhang He over Xiahou Ba since his air special is slightly faster to setup and his higher jump makes navigation with him feel more agile before and afterwards too.

It can be hard to control your exact altitude after doing the wallzip because Zhang He's animation speed is so fast. He will overshoot and do a "bounce" in air right after the air special ends, so you actually have to wait for a short moment before switching characters to get maximum height out of the zip.

### Average sloped floor clip

Zhang He can generate such a high temporary velocity with a speed buffed C4 that he can clip through some sloped floor, like the staircase in Nanzhong. However, this technique has its limitations, and it doesn't seem to work at shorter stairs (like in Anegawa).

### Average combat setup

Being able to speed buff gives him some advantage in less straightforward combat encounters.

### Skill breakpoints

Each use of his air special costs 45 musou. At lv. 1, he gets 4 uses before running out of musou. At lv. 13, he gets 5 uses.

### Other notes

Zhang He has no known way to attack through walls.

Zhang He seems to be able to do a S1 -> S2 -> C2 combo using a delayed input trick, but it's frame precise.

He falls down very fast while his speed is buffed. Knowing this might be useful in the rare case where you need to fall down quickly.

If you use Zhang He's speed buff and then get on a mount, the whole mount gets the shadow image effect of the speed buff but doesn't actually become faster.

The speed buff ends early if Zhang He uses his musou, but the graphical effect still remains active for a time. Starting TTA also ends the speed buff early.

## Zhang Liao

• Technique / Fellowship + Trinity

### Great angled glitch

He can breach up to thick walls while angled using his musou. Sprint attack and C4 also work for thin obstacles.

### Average high jump

His highest known jump is jump (side towards wall) -> air special -> (turning towards wall) air charge attack, which allows him to get over around 1 tier and 3 steps in Luoyang.

### Good infinite jump

His air special has a fairly quick animation and it moves him forward and upward a short distance. It can be a useful part of an infinite jump combo even though he doesn't have double jump.

### Speed buff ability

Zhang Liao can use his EX to give himself a 10-second buff which makes all of his animations roughly 25-30% faster. This even affects non-combat animations like swimming and ladder climbing. The combo for reaching EX is a bit lengthy so the speed buff takes a few seconds to set up, but the animation of the EX itself can be cut short early if you have Dragon's Eye or Heavenly Sash. The speed buff will end by itself after the timer runs out, switch characters or do a musou.

Zhang Liao is still limited by the universal Speed cap while his speed is buffed. Jumping everywhere instead of running might help increase your overall speed, like it does with Xiahou Ba / Zhang He speed buff, but I'm not sure if it's enough to consistently break Speed cap.

The slow setup prevents this from being used as an universal speed movement tactic, but it could still come in handy if you can start it during forced waiting.

### Good wallzip?

Zhang Liao is theoretically a more consistent wallzip character than most because he can buff the speed of his animations.

### Average combat setup

The animation speed buff could help him prepare ahead for complex combat scenarios.

### Other notes

He has no known way to attack through walls.

If you interrupt his C3 grab animation during its first frames with Dragon's Eye, he will do a sidestep to a seemingly random direction. This only works with Dragon's Eye - Heavenly Sash cannot cancel the grab like this and instead has no effect.

If you end Zhang Liao's speed buff early with a musou, the speed buff's visual effect will still be active afterwards for a few seconds even though actions are no longer sped up.

Riding a horse while speed buffed makes the entire horse emit a double image like Zhang Liao himself. Sadly, the speed of the horse is not increased.

## Zhenji

• Technique / Technique + Recovery

### Good angled glitch

She is able to bypass up to medium-thick walls while angled by doing her sprint attack or C4.

### Average high jump

Her highest known jump is jump -> air special -> air charge attack, which is enough to cross tier 1 and 4 steps in Luoyang.

### Average infinite jump

She can be used as a part of an infinite jump chain to at least hover in place, although the air special is fairly slow.

### Speed buff ability

Zhenji can use her EX to speed up all her animations by about 30% for a short amount of time. It's similar to Zhang Liao's speed buff, but actually better in a few respects: it's faster to set up since Zhenji's EX is a much shorter combo string, and the actual speed buff itself lasts longer too, around 11-12 seconds compared to Zhang Liao's 10 seconds. The EX animation can be interrupted early if you have Dragon's Eye or Heavenly Sash to squeeze a bit more value out of the buff. The speed buff will end by itself after the timer runs out, switch characters or do a musou.

Zhenji is still limited by the universal Speed cap while his speed is buffed. Jumping everywhere instead of running might help increase your overall speed, like it does with Xiahou Ba / Zhang He speed buff, but I'm not sure if it's enough to consistently break Speed cap.

### Good wallzip?

Zhenji is theoretically a more consistent wallzip character than most because she can buff the speed of her animations.

### Average combat setup

The animation speed buff could help her prepare ahead for complex combat scenarios.

### Other notes

She has no way to attack through walls for now.

She is able to do a S1 -> S2 -> C2 combo with a precise timing using a delayed input trick. To do this, first input S1 and S2 in a quick succession, then do a charge attack during the first frames of S2. This will cancel into C2 instead of C3.

If you end Zhenji's speed buff early with a musou, the speed buff's visual effect will still be active afterwards for a few seconds even though actions are no longer sped up.

While speed buffed, riding a horse makes the entire horse emit a double image like Zhenji herself. Sadly, the speed of the horse is not increased.

## Technical stuff

I've used the following criteria for determining speedrun usefulness:

- Speed movement. How fast a character can move solo. By default, testing takes into account Agility 10 on weapon but assumes default Speed. This is for two reasons: firstly, assuming everyone is at base Speed is more useful for covering original WO3 tactics where upgrade stone duping did not exist. Secondly, Agility 10 is easier to set up in full game runs than 360 Speed, so realistically you'd encounter a situation where a character has Agility on weapon but only base Speed more often than the other way around.
- - 0 = character's maximum speed does not exceed 150. 1 = character's maximum speed is under 200, does not obsolete a horse. 2 = character's maximum speed is over 200, can obsolete a horse. 3 = character can move at Speed cap or go over it. Half a point may be added or removed because of conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can pass Speed cap in steep downhill areas but nowhere else.
 
- Angled glitch. How good a character is for going under walls while angled. Characters who have a convenient access to lengthy non-looping attacks that propel them forward work the best for this purpose.
- - 0 = character cannot pass any kind of walls while angled. 1 = character can pass thin walls while angled. 2 = character can pass medium-thick walls while angled. 3 = character can pass thick walls while angled. Half a point may be added or removed for conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can breach thick walls but the attack for doing so is inconvenient, like the last hit of a slow combo string.
 
- Attacking through walls. How well a character can snipe targets through walls.
- - 0 = character can't hit anything through walls. 1 = character can hit a short distance (2-5 meters) through walls. 2 = character can hit a medium distance (around 5 - 10 meters) through walls. 3 = character can hit a long or even arbitrarily long distance through walls. Note that these meter amounts are just rough estimates. Half a point may be added or removed for conditionality, i.e. a character might get 2,5 if they can hit a long distance through walls, but you need a specific setup to do so.
 
- Solo high jump. What's the highest jump a character can do solo. My testing has been done in Luoyang, where there's a tiered staircase with a ledge above it.
- - 0 = character can't pass the lowest tier in Luoyang. 1 = character can pass the first tier in Luoyang. 2 = character can pass the second tier in Luoyang. 3 = character can skip the staircase and jump up the above ledge from the ground level. Half a point may be added if a character's highest jump is around the middle of two tiers.
 
- Solo long jump. What's the longest jump a character can do solo.
- - 0 = character can jump less than a double jump's worth. 1 = character can jump a double jump's worth. 2 = character can jump triple or quadruple jump's worth. 3 = character can glide or fly for even longer than that.
 
- Team jumping (horizontal). How well a team member can contribute in an infinite jump which needs to have a good horizontal reach.
- - 0 = character is incompatible with infinite jumping. 1 = character can sustain an infinite jump with no real contribution. 2 = character is helpful in an infinite jump. 3 = character is a superb infinite jumper.

- Team jumping (vertical). How well a team member can contribute in an infinite jump that just needs to get height as quick as possible.
- - 0 = character is incompatible with infinite jumping. 1 = character can sustain an infinite jump with no real contribution. 2 = character is helpful in an infinite jump. 3 = character is a superb infinite jumper.
 
- Wallzipping. How good is a character in wallzipping? Zhang He and Xiahou Ba belong in a tier of their own because of their superb speed buff that makes wallzipping more consistent for them than anyone else.
- - 0 = characters who have no wallzip-compatible attacks. 1 = characters who can do a wallzip. 2 = characters who can buff their own speed for more consistent wallzips. 3 = Zhang He and Xiahou Ba.

- Combat setup. Does a character have any tools to save time in less straightforward combat encounters, for instance if officers spawn with a delay or from multiple directions. For instance, Dong Zhuo can leave multiple bombs which can kill multiple officers in different parts of the same room right as they spawn, saving a lot of time compared to another character who would have to take care of them with normal attacks.
- - 0 = no way to setup delayed damage or prepare in any other way. 1 = inconsistent or weak delayed damage or setup. 2 = good delayed damage or setup. 3 = incredible delayed damage or setup.

- Sloped floor clip. Can a character clip through sloped floor?
- - 0 = no way to clip through sloped floor. 1 = very situational sloped floor clip. 2 = better sloped floor clip ability. 3 = best sloped floor clip ability.

It would make this guide a bit dry and unreadable if I included every category for every character, so for now I've just focused on talking about each character's highlights. But perhaps I could add a LibreOffice Calc sheet which lists everyone's numbers at some point, once I've finished testing.
